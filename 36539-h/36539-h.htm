<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>Not long after my edition of this Father&rsquo;s writings
appeared in the <i>Cambridge Patristic Texts</i> (1904), I
was invited to translate the Letters and some of the
other more certainly genuine fragments that remain
into English for the present series; but it is not
until now that I have been able to accomplish the
task I then undertook. Since then, though chiefly
occupied in other researches, I have naturally acquired
a more extensive and accurate knowledge of St.
Dionysius and his times, some of the results of which
will be found in this volume. Nevertheless, I was
bound to incorporate a considerable amount of the
information and conclusions arrived at in the former
work, and wish to express my acknowledgments to
the Syndics of the University Press for leave to
do so, as well as to those again whose names I
mentioned as having assisted me before.</p>
<p>In the present book Dr. A. J. Mason was kind
enough to advise me over the choice of extracts
from the two treatises, <i>On Nature</i> and <i>Refutation and
Defence</i>, and on one or two minor points, while a
friend and neighbour (the Rev. L. Patterson) read
through the whole of the MS. before it went to the
printer and gave me the benefit of a fresh mind upon
a number of small details of style and fact, for which
I sincerely thank him.</p>

<h2 id="c2">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>1. None of the many influential occupants of the
see of Alexandria and of the many distinguished
heads of the Catechetical School in that city seem
to have been held in higher respect by the ancients
than Dionysius. By common consent he is styled
&ldquo;the Great,&rdquo; while Athanasius, one of his most
famous-successors as Bishop, calls him &ldquo;Teacher of
the Church universal,&rdquo; and Basil (of C&aelig;sarea) refers
to him as &ldquo;a person of canonical authority&rdquo;
(<span title="kanonikos" class="g">&kappa;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span>).
He took a prominent and important part in all the
leading movements and controversies of the day,
and his opinions always carried great weight, especially
in Eastern Christendom. His writings are
freely referred to and quoted, not only by Eusebius
the historian,<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup> but also by Athanasius, Basil and John
of Damascus amongst others. And what we gather
of his personal story from his letters and various
fragments embodied in the works of others&mdash;and
very little, if anything else, for certain has come down
to us&mdash;undoubtedly leaves the impression that the
verdict of the ancient world is correct.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">His Family and Earlier Life</span></h3>
<p>2. The references to his family and early years are
extremely scanty and vague. In the <i>Chronicon
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Orientale</i>, p. 94, he is stated to have been a <i>Sabaita</i> and
sprung from &ldquo;the chiefs and nobles of that race&rdquo;:
and several writers speak as if he had been a rhetorician
before his conversion (as Cyprian of Carthage
had been). The exact meaning of the term &ldquo;Sabaita&rdquo;
above is doubtful. Strictly used, it should mean a
member of the Sabaite convent near Jerusalem, and
the <i>Chronicon</i> may be claiming Dionysius as that,
though, of course, without any ground for the claim.
If it is equivalent, however, to &ldquo;Sab&aelig;an&rdquo; here, it
implies an Arab descent for him, which is hardly
probable, as he seems always to consider himself connected
by education and residence, if not by birth,
with the city-folk of Alexandria, whom he distinguishes
from the Coptic inhabitants of Egypt
(<span title="Aigyptioi" class="g">&Alpha;&#7984;&gamma;&#8059;&pi;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&iota;</span>);
so that it would be rather surprising to find that his
family came from the remoter parts of Arabia, where
the Sab&aelig;ans dwelt. The other tradition of his
having been a rhetorician may be due to some
confusion between our Dionysius and a much later
Alexandrian writer of the same name, who edited
the works of the Areopagite with notes and wrote
other treatises. On the other hand, Dionysius&rsquo;s
literary style is such that it might very well have
been formed by the study and practice of rhetoric,
while he has been thought himself to corroborate
the statement of the <i>Chronicon Orientale</i>, as to the
high position of his family, in his reply to Germanus
(<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>),
where he refers to the &ldquo;losses of dignities&rdquo;
which he has suffered for the Faith.</p>
<p>3. He was probably a priest, and not less than
thirty, when he became head of the Catechetical School
in 231, and in 264 he excused himself from attendance
at the Council of Antioch on the ground of age and
infirmity; and so it is a safe inference that he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
born about or before 200, being thus nearly of an age
with Cyprian of Carthage, and only ten or fifteen
years younger than Origen, his master.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">His Conversion</span></h3>
<p>4. The <i>Chronicon Orientale</i> assigns the reading of
St. Paul&rsquo;s letters as the cause of his conversion to
Christianity, and proceeds to state how, after their
perusal, he presented himself for baptism to Demetrius,
then Bishop of Alexandria, who admitted him
in due course. Whether this was actually the cause
of his conversion or not, we know from what he has
himself told us in his letter to Philemon
(<a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>),
that both before and after baptism he was a diligent
student of all that was written for and against
Christianity.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Was He Married or Not?</span></h3>
<p>5. Whether, in accordance with the common
practice of the Eastern Church at that time, Dionysius
was married or not, is a moot point. He addressed his treatise
<span title="peri Physe&ocirc;s" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &Phi;&#8059;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;</span>
to one Timotheus
<span title="ho pais" class="g">&#8001; &pi;&alpha;&#8150;&sigmaf;</span>,
and we read of
<span title="hoi paides" class="g">&#8001;&iota; &pi;&alpha;&#8150;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>
(of whom Timotheus was one) as accompanying him in his flight
(<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>).
One would naturally infer from this that he was then a
widower (his wife not being mentioned), and that
these were his sons; but they may have been his
pupils, on the supposition that he was still Catechete
as well as Bishop, or, which is less likely, his
servants.<sup><a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="sc">He becomes Head of the Catechetical School</span></h3>
<p>6. When Demetrius died in 231, Heraclas, who for
some years had been associated with Origen at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Catechetical School and had just been left in charge
of it by him on his final retirement that year from
Alexandria, was elected Bishop, while Dionysius,
who had himself been a pupil of Origen there, was
appointed to fill the vacancy he created. It is
possible that the treatise
<span title="peri Physe&ocirc;s" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &Phi;&#8059;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;</span>,
extracts from which are given below (on
<a href="#Page_91">pp. 91 ff.</a>),
was composed while Dionysius held this important post, and
that a commentary on <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, some genuine
fragments of which probably remain, belongs to the
same period. The former of these is much the more
valuable work, for in it for the first time a Christian
undertook systematically to refute the atomistic
theories of Epicurus and his followers.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">He becomes Bishop of Alexandria</span></h3>
<p>7. Sixteen years later, in 247, upon the death of
Heraclas, Dionysius succeeded to the bishopric as
the fourteenth occupant of the see, possibly, as has
already been suggested, without at once resigning
his post at the School. Philip the Arabian (of
Bostra) had then been Emperor for three years, a
position he was destined to retain for two years
longer. Like Alexander Severus before him, he was
known to favour the Christians, and Dionysius himself
bears witness to the comparative mildness of his rule
(<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>).
For a short time, therefore, the
new Bishop and his flock were left in peace, though
even before the death of Philip signs of the coming
storm appeared. In the last year of his reign
Dionysius tells Fabius, Bishop of Antioch
(<a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>),
that &ldquo;the prophet and poet of evil to this city,
whoever he was,&rdquo; stirred up the populace against the
Christians in Alexandria, and several persons were
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
cruelly martyred. This reign of terror lasted some
time, but was interrupted in the autumn of 249 by
the revolution which caused the deposition and
death of Philip, and which set Decius on the throne
in his stead. The respite was only too brief, for by
the beginning of the new year the edict which Decius
had issued was being actively carried into effect.
The Bishops were at first singled out for attack.
Origen, though not one of them, was included among
the earlier victims&mdash;on account, no doubt, of his
prominence as a scholar and a teacher&mdash;being
imprisoned at Tyre and cruelly tortured, though not
actually martyred.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Under the Persecution of Decius</span></h3>
<p>8. Decius&rsquo;s reversal of his predecessor&rsquo;s policy
towards the Christians was probably due to reasons
of state and expediency rather than, as Eusebius
implies, to mere spite and hatred of Philip and all
his ways. Anyhow, the severity of the Decian persecution
is undoubted, and it fell with great force upon
the Church at Alexandria. The Prefect of Egypt,
Sabinus, lost no time in attacking Dionysius and his
followers. Many endured tortures or death, or both.
Dionysius himself, after waiting four days, fled and
was sought for by a secret service messenger (<i>frumentarius</i>,
see <a href="#Page_43">note on p. 43</a>)
sent by Sabinus. A brief search was sufficient to recover him,
and he was carried off with four of his companions to Taposiris.
But through a strange interposition of Providence (related on
<a href="#Page_44">pp. 44 f.</a>)
he was rescued by a wedding
party of rustic revellers and removed to a place of
safety in the Libyan Desert, where he appears to have
been left unmolested, with two of his four companions
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
(see <a href="#Page_64">pp. 64 ff.</a>),
till the persecution ceased and he was able to
return to the city. In after days Dionysius&rsquo;s
action in fleeing on this occasion was violently
attacked by a certain Bishop Germanus, who was
perhaps one of his suffragans. Germanus boasted
of his own much braver conduct under persecution.
Dionysius in his reply (see especially pp.
<a href="#Page_43">43</a> and
<a href="#Page_45">45</a>)
maintains that it was not of his own will nor yet
without divine intimation that he had fled, and that
he had suffered far more than his critic for the Faith.
Decius&rsquo;s rule was brought to a calamitous end in
251, but Gallus, who succeeded him, continued his
treatment of the Christians for another two years,
when he, too, suffered an untimely fate.</p>
<p>9. For the next four years the Church of Alexandria enjoyed
comparative rest and peace. In 253 &AElig;milianus<sup><a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></sup>
the Governor of Pannonia and M&oelig;sia,
who had in that spring wrested the imperial power
from Gallus, was in his turn, after four months&rsquo; rule,
defeated by Valerian and his son Gallienus, and slain
by the soldiery. The new Emperors (father and son)
left the Christians alone during the first four years
of their reign&mdash;a somewhat surprising fact, when it
is considered that Valerian had been specially chosen
to fill the office of &ldquo;Censor,&rdquo; which Decius had
revived. It may in some measure have been due
to what Archbishop Benson (<i>Cyprian</i>, p. 457) calls
his &ldquo;languid temperament&rdquo; as well as to his son&rsquo;s
connexions with the Christians through his wife
Cornelia Salonina.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h3><span class="sc">His Action about Heretical Baptism</span></h3>
<p>10. During this interval of peace, but chiefly
towards the end of it, Dionysius took part in that
controversy about heretical baptism to which the letters on
<a href="#Page_51">pp. 51 ff.</a>
belong. Up till now various parts
of Christendom had followed various customs on this
matter without much disputing. In Asia Minor and
in Africa baptism by heretics was not recognized,
while in the West baptism with water in the name
of the Trinity or of Christ was held valid by whomsoever
performed. Before the middle of the third century,
however, the difference of practice gradually
became more and more a matter of controversy. In or
about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 230 two synods were held one after the
other at Iconium and at Synnada (see
<a href="#Page_58">p. 58, <i>n.</i></a>),
which confirmed the opinion that heretical baptism was
invalid: and some twenty-five years later on Cyprian
of Carthage convened several synods in North Africa,
which arrived at the same conclusion. Thereupon
a violent quarrel arose between Cyprian and Stephen
the Bishop of Rome; this became, perhaps, all the
keener, because of the former alliance and co-operation
between Cyprian and Stephen&rsquo;s predecessor,
Cornelius, in combating the Novatianist schism,<sup><a id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></sup>
which had eventually led also to heresy over the
restoration of those who had lapsed under persecution.
Severe language was now used on both sides,
and other leading Churchmen of the day were naturally
drawn into the discussion: among them our Dionysius,
who&mdash;after the first, at all events&mdash;with
characteristic sagacity steered a middle course and
advised that the older spirit of toleration should be
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
maintained, the circumstances of different churches
requiring different methods. Fragments of five
letters on this subject have come down to us, all
addressed to the Church of Rome or rather to representative
members of that Church, the first of them probably
written in 254 when the Novatianist schism was subsiding
(<a href="#Page_52">see p. 52</a>),
and the others belonging to the year 257
(<a href="#Page_54">see pp. 54 ff.</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Under the Persecution of Valerian</span></h3>
<p>11. Suddenly, in the summer of that year, the
Church was startled by the issue of an edict which
revived the reign of terror and threw her into a state
of persecution which lasted for more than three years.
This unexpected change of treatment is attributed
by Dionysius to the influence of Macrianus, who
at one time held the office of <i>Rationalis</i> (Treasurer
or Accountant-General) to the Emperor. This man
was apparently a cripple in body, but mentally and
otherwise a person of considerable ability and force
of character: but he seems to have associated himself
in some way with the soothsayers of Egypt,<sup><a id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></sup>
and to have conceived a violent hatred against the
Christians. Quite early in the proceedings which
were instituted against them at Alexandria in consequence
of the edict, Dionysius, with several of his clergy, was
brought before &AElig;milianus the Prefect,<sup><a id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></sup>
and after examination&mdash;chiefly as to his loyalty to
the Emperors, which his refusal to pay them divine
honours rendered doubtful&mdash;was banished first to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
place called Cephro (probably not far from Taposiris,
where he had been sent before), and then somewhere
on the high road in the district called Colluthion.
Dionysius&rsquo;s own account of the circumstances which
led to and attended this second exile is given on
<a href="#Page_46">pp. 46 ff.</a>,
an account which is valuable, among other
reasons, because it is largely drawn from the official
memoranda of the Prefect&rsquo;s court, and because it
shows how both sides did their ineffectual best to
understand each other&rsquo;s position.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Restoration of Peace</span></h3>
<p>12. The persecution lasted till the autumn of 260,
and was then, on the disappearance of Valerian,
stayed by an edict of Peace issued by his son Gallienus,
who was now left alone upon the throne. The
Greek version, which Eusebius gives us, is apparently
not that of the actual edict, but of the Emperor&rsquo;s
letter or rescript which applied it to Egypt. It is
addressed to Dionysius and other bishops, and runs
as follows: &ldquo;I have ordained that the benefit of
my concession be enforced throughout the world,
to the effect that men should withdraw from (<i>i. e.</i>
not interfere with) your places of worship. And
accordingly ye, too, may use the terms of my rescript,
so that none may interfere with you. And this,
which may with authority be carried out by you,
has already been granted by me some time ago.
And accordingly Aurelius Quirinius, who is in charge
of the Exchequer,<sup><a id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></sup> shall preserve this form now given
by me.&rdquo; Instructions were also issued permitting
the Christians to have free access to their cemeteries&mdash;a
privilege which was always much prized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h3><span class="sc">His Return to Alexandria</span></h3>
<p>13. It is practically certain that Dionysius returned
to Alexandria as soon as Gallienus&rsquo;s edict came into
operation there. But almost immediately fresh
disturbances were felt in the city, followed by one
of those frequent outbreaks of pestilence to which
the East was always liable, and these hindered for a
time his work of bringing the brethren together
again. The disturbances are with good reason thought
to have been those connected with the attempt of
Macrianus to overturn the power of Gallienus in
Egypt, though that country was so often the scene
of tumults and civil wars for the next twelve years
and more that it is almost impossible to identify
any particular disturbances with certainty during
this period.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Troubles Connected with his Protest against Sabellianism</span></h3>
<p>14. For another five years Dionysius was spared
to administer his charge and to benefit the Church
at large with his prudent counsels. But, though
attacks upon himself never seem to have troubled
him very much, he had still to endure one such attack
which probably grieved him more than all the rest,
and the after results of which lingered on till the days
of Athanasius and Basil in the next century. This
was in connexion with the Sabellian controversy,
especially that phase of it which had recently arisen
in the Libyan Pentapolis (on the north-west coast of
Cyrenaica). Sabellius was a native of the district,
and his heresy consisted in laying too much stress on
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the unity of the Godhead and in so hopelessly confounding
the Three Persons in the Trinity as to imply that the Person
of the Father was incarnate in Christ. It is in 257 that we
first find Dionysius, in a letter to Xystus II
(<a href="#Page_55">see p. 55</a>),
calling the attention
of the Bishop of Rome to these views, by which time
Sabellius was himself probably already dead. From
what he says there, it appears as if Dionysius was
unaware that these views were not of quite recent
origin and were already rather prevalent in both
East and West, whilst his words seem also to imply
that this later phase of Sabellianism endangered the
dignity of the Third Person as well as of the First
and Second. In Libya the heresy gained such a
hold upon the Church that it even infected certain
of the Bishops, and the Son of God was no longer
preached. Dionysius, therefore, feeling his responsibility
for the churches under his care, became active
in trying to eradicate the evil. Among a number of
letters which he wrote on the subject, there was one
(about the year 260) in which he made use of certain
expressions and illustrations with regard to the Son
of God, which were seized hold of by some members
of the Church either at Alexandria or in the Pentapolis
as heretical. This letter was apparently one of
the later letters of the series, when his earlier overtures
had failed to produce the effect he desired.</p>
<p>15. Dionysius&rsquo;s critics laid a formal complaint
against him before his namesake (Dionysius), who had
by now succeeded the martyred Xystus II as Bishop
of Rome; they accused him of having fallen into
five errors himself, while correcting the false views
of the Sabellians.</p>
<p>They were as follows, as we gather them from
Athan., <i>de sent. Dion.</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) Separating the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>(2) Denying the eternity of the Son.</p>
<p>(3) Naming the Father without the Son and the
Son without the Father.</p>
<p>(4) Virtually rejecting the term
<span title="homoousios" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&omicron;&#8059;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
(of one substance) as descriptive of the Son.</p>
<p>(5) Speaking of the Son as a creature of the
Father and using misleading illustrations
of their relation to One Another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One or two of these illustrations which were
objected to will be found in the extract translated on
<a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a>,
and they are sufficient to give some idea of
the rest. It may, however, be acknowledged that
neither Dionysius himself in his original statements
and in his attempts to explain them, nor Athanasius,
who, when Arius afterwards appealed to Dionysius
in support of his opinions, put forward an elaborate
defence of him, was altogether happy or successful.</p>
<p>16. Upon receiving the complaint mentioned, the
Bishop of Rome appears to have convened a synod,
which condemned the expressions complained of, and
a letter was addressed by him on the modes of correcting
the heresy to the Church of Alexandria. From
motives of delicacy he made no actual mention of
his Alexandrian brother-bishop in this letter, while
criticizing his views, though he wrote to him privately
asking for an explanation. A considerable portion
of the public letter has been preserved for us by
Athanasius, but it is not included in this volume,
nor is it necessary to particularize his treatment of
the question or to say more than this, that, though
the Roman Bishop wrote quite good Greek and gives
no impression that he felt hampered by it in expressing
his meaning, yet he does naturally exhibit distinct
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
traces of Western modes of thought as opposed to
Eastern, and is not always quite fair in his representation
and interpretation of what Dionysius had said.</p>
<p>Dionysius&rsquo;s answer to his Roman brother was
embodied in the treatise called <i>Refutation and Defence</i>
(<span title="Elenchos kai Apologia" class="g">&#7964;&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&chi;&omicron;&sigma; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7944;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#8055;&alpha;</span>),
some extracts from which (as given by Athanasius) will be found on
<a href="#Page_101">pp. 101 ff.</a></p>
<p>The following is an indication of Dionysius&rsquo;s line
of defence against the five points raised against him,
other matters which arose more particularly between
him and his namesake of Rome being passed over.</p>
<p>(1) As to the charge of separating the Three Persons
in the Trinity, he distinctly denies it: all the language
he employs and the very names he gives imply the opposite:
&ldquo;Father&rdquo; must involve &ldquo;Son&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Son&rdquo; &ldquo;Father&rdquo;: &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo;
at once suggests His Source and the Channel.</p>
<p>(2) As to the eternity of the Son, he is equally
emphatic. God was always the Father and therefore
Christ was always the Son, just as, if the sun
were eternal, the daylight would also be eternal.</p>
<p>(3) The charge of omitting the Son in speaking of
the Father and vice versa is refuted by what is said
under (1): the one name involves the other.</p>
<p>(4) Dionysius&rsquo;s rejection or non-employment of the term
<span title="homoousios" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&omicron;&#8059;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
is less easily disposed of. He
practically acknowledges that, as it is not a Scriptural
word, he had <i>not</i> used it, but at the same time that
the figures he employed suggested a similar relationship,
<i>e. g.</i> the figure of parent and child who are of one family
(<span title="homogeneis" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigmaf;</span>)
or seed, root and plant which are of one kind
(<span title="homophy&ecirc;" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&phi;&upsilon;&#8134;</span>),
and again source and stream, and in another place the word in the
heart and the mind springing forth by the tongue (see
<a href="#Page_106">p. 106</a>):
but for the unsatisfactoriness of this defence the reader
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
should consult Bethune-Baker, <i>Early History of
Christian Doctrine</i>, chap. viii. pp. 113 ff, who points
out that Dionysius had not grasped the Western
tradition of one <i>substantia</i>
(<span title="ousia" class="g">&omicron;&#8016;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;</span>)
of Godhead existing in three Persons.</p>
<p>(5) But the most serious misunderstanding naturally
arose from Dionysius speaking of the Son as
<span title="poi&ecirc;ma" class="g">&pi;&omicron;&#8055;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</span>
(creature), and illustrating the word by the
gardener with his vine and the shipwright with his
boat. His defence is that though he had undoubtedly
used such rather unsuitable figures somewhat casually,
he had immediately adduced several others more
suitable and apposite (such as those mentioned under
(4) above). And he complains that not only here,
but throughout, his accusers did not take his utterances
as a whole, but slashed his writings about and
made what sense of them they liked, not sincerely, but with
evil intent. He tries further to explain that in his context
<span title="poiein" class="g">&pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&#8150;&nu;</span>
(make) was equivalent to
<span title="gennan" class="g">&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;&#8118;&nu;</span>
(beget), as of a Father, not a Creator, which he maintains is
legitimate, but the defence is not very convincing all the same.</p>
<p>So far as we can now judge, however, his arguments
seem to have satisfied his critics at the time, and were
certainly held in high repute by the ancient Churches,
for they are quoted or referred to not only by Athanasius,
as has been stated, but also by Eusebius, by
Basil of C&aelig;sarea (who is, however, much more
temperate in his support), and by Jerome and Rufinus.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Dionysius&rsquo;s Last Days</span></h3>
<p>17. It is evident that, in spite of this controversy,
his great reputation in the eyes of the Church was
maintained to the end: for when the Council of
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Antioch was being summoned to deal with the troubles
connected with the heresies of Paul of Samosata, who held
views somewhat similar to those of Sabellius, Dionysius
was specially invited to attend. As was said above on
<a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>,
he excused himself from attendance on the ground of old age
and infirmity, but he sent a letter in reply to the invitation
which contained his views on the matter, and these were
unfavourable to the heretic. In 265, before the Council had
finished its sessions, he passed to his well-earned rest.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Dionysius as Author</span></h3>
<p>18. From what has already been said, it will be
gathered that Dionysius was a person of remarkable
versatility, and at the same time unusually free
from those snares of the versatile man, shallowness
and inaccuracy. The critical remarks on the Revelation
of S. John the Divine from his treatise <i>On the Promises</i>
(<span title="peri Epangeli&ocirc;n" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &#7960;&pi;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&#8182;&nu;</span>),
which are given in full (from Eusebius) on
<a href="#Page_82">pp. 82 ff.</a>,
have received the most respectful consideration from such
authorities as Bishop Westcott and Dr. Swete and are well
worth reading, while some of the expositions of Biblical
passages attributed to him are probably genuine and
by no means destitute of merit, though none of
them are printed in this volume.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">As Christian Philosopher</span></h3>
<p>19. The long extracts which remain from his book <i>On Nature</i>
(<span title="peri Physe&ocirc;s" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &Phi;&#8059;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;</span>),
directed against the Epicureans, show him to have possessed
on the whole a clear grasp of their tenets, together with
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
much genuine humour and entire absence of bitterness
of spirit in criticizing them.</p>
<p>The extracts given by Eusebius appear to be fairly
continuous throughout: they deal (1) with the
atomistic portion of the Epicurean philosophy, and
(2) with the more strictly &ldquo;theological&rdquo; portion of
it, the references to the hedonistic doctrine being
only slight and passing.</p>
<p>Dionysius begins by remarking that of the various
hypotheses which have been started as to the origin
of the universe, one of the least satisfactory is that of
Epicurus, viz. that it is the result of a chance concourse
of an infinite number of atoms, as they rush
through space.</p>
<p>He then proceeds to show by a series of illustrations
taken from human workmanship that mere chance
could never produce the wonderful results that we
see all around us. So, too, from the study of the
heavens the same inference must be drawn.</p>
<p>His next point appears to be that the difference in
durability, which Epicurus postulates for the various
bodies produced by atoms, goes to upset his theory.
If some products (<i>e. g.</i> the gods) are eternal and some
are short-lived, what determines the difference?
Some of the senseless atoms themselves must be
gifted with powers of directing, arranging and ruling.
But if it is mere chance, then Epicurus asks us, who
study the order and the phenomena of earth and
heaven, to believe the impossible.</p>
<p>The same conclusion is arrived at by the study of
man, whose mere body is a machine so marvellous
that some have emerged from the study of it with a belief that
<span title="Physis" class="g">&Phi;&#8059;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>
herself is a deity. The higher powers, too, of man,
his mind and reason and skill, all point in the opposite
direction to Epicurus&rsquo;s solution of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
problem. It cannot, surely, be the atoms rather than
the Muses which are responsible for the arts and
sciences.</p>
<p>The half-humorous allusion to these heaven-born
personages of heathen mythology leads Dionysius
to attack the Epicurean theory of the gods. According
to Epicurus, the gods in no way concern themselves
with mundane matters, but spend a serene
existence without labour or exertion of any kind.
But such an existence, says Dionysius, is so repugnant
to the very idea and instinct of man that it must be
absolutely false with regard to divine beings.</p>
<p>At this point occurs a short passage in which the
inconsistency of Democritus, from whom Epicurus had
confessedly borrowed his physics, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
is criticized, though it has only a general bearing
upon the line of argument. Democritus, he says,
who professed that he would have given the world
in exchange for the discovery of one good cause
(<span title="aitiologia" class="g">&alpha;&#7984;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#8055;&alpha;</span>),
yet in putting forward his ideas of Chance as a cause could
not have been more absurd: he sets up
<span title="Tych&ecirc;" class="g">&Tau;&#8059;&chi;&eta;</span>
as the sovereign cause of the Universe,
and yet banishes her as a power from the life of men.
The truth is that, while practical men and even
philosophers find their highest pleasure in benefiting
others, by this theory the gods are to be kept from
any share in such pleasure.</p>
<p>One other inconsistency in the Epicurean writings
Dionysius next deals with, and that is Epicurus&rsquo;s
own constant use of oaths and adjurations, in which
the names of those very beings occur whose influence
upon men&rsquo;s affairs he so depreciates. This is, in
Dionysius&rsquo;s opinion, due to his fear of being put to
death by the state for atheism, as Socrates had been:
though he is probably doing Epicurus a wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>The extracts end with a repetition of the appeal
to the wonders of the sky and of the earth as a
conclusive contradiction of Epicurus&rsquo;s views.<sup><a id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>A selection from these interesting portions of a
not unimportant work for its time will be found on
<a href="#Page_91">pp. 91 ff.</a></p>
<h3><span class="sc">General Characteristics of his Writings</span></h3>
<p>20. The letter to Basilides on several points of ecclesiastical
order (the larger portion of which is given on
<a href="#Page_76">pp. 76 ff.</a>)
is a model of what such episcopal utterances should be:
it definitely states which is the highest and best course,
but leaves the decision to the individual conscience. But
it is to the general correspondence
(<a href="#Page_35">pp. 35 ff.</a>)
that the bulk of English
readers will probably turn, and that deals with a large
variety of subjects: in some cases theological matters
like Novatianism and the baptism of heretics are
discussed; in others there are descriptions of the
martyrdoms of his time at Alexandria and his own
personal experiences under persecution, all told
with a vividness and a sobriety eminently characteristic
of the man: others are addressed to persons
or districts in his province, especially at Eastertide,
treating of matters of local and temporary importance,
while one or two incidents which he records are of
much value as illustrating church customs and
manners of the period (<i>e. g.</i> the case of Sarapion on
<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>,
prayers for the Emperors on
<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>,
matters connected with the celebration of Holy Baptism and
Holy Communion on
<a href="#Page_59">p. 59</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>In his controversy with the Sabellians, as we have
already remarked, some of the expressions and
figures employed were insufficiently guarded or
explained and so laid Dionysius open to criticism:
but we must remember how much more easy it is for
us, who have the benefit of subsequent history and
experience, to see this and to correct it, than it was
for him and for his contemporaries to grope their
way, as they slowly but surely did, under the Divine
guidance to a fuller knowledge and a more accurate
statement of the truth.</p>
<p>21. It is further to be noticed how very seldom, if
ever, Dionysius offends against the principles of good
taste either when attacking opponents, or when describing
horrors, or when dealing with the mysteries
of the Faith. In controversy he always displays an
admirable moderation and sweetness of tone, which
is the more remarkable because his convictions were
strong and definite. This is especially to be observed
in his treatment of Novatianus the intruder
(see <a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>),
in his criticism of the deceased Nepos of Arsenoe
(see <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>),
and to a less extent in his defence of
himself against the charges of Germanus
(see <a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>).
Even when he has to speak of one whom he believes
to have done him wrong, like the Prefect &AElig;milianus
(<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>),
or of one whom his soul abhors like Macrianus
(<a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>),
his language is mild in comparison with that of many in
similar circumstances. So, too, when he takes upon himself
to describe the tortures and deaths of the martyrs
(<a href="#Page_35">pp. 35 f.</a>),
or the ravages of pestilence
(<a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a>),
he indulges in but few ghastly or revolting
details, though his narrative is always lively and
thrilling. And once more when he deals with such
a subject as the Eternal Sonship of our Lord, or, if
the passage (not here given) be authentic, His Death
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and Passion, the same good taste and restraint of
language is to be observed.</p>
<p>22. Dionysius&rsquo;s literary style is excellent for the
age in which he lived, and so far confirms the truth
of the statement that he had been a master of rhetoric
before his conversion. He gives evidence of having
read widely and to good purpose both in classical
and in religious literature. As to the former, he
actually quotes from or refers to Homer, Hesiod,
Thucydides, Aristotle, and Democritus: but his language
is really saturated with classical uses, and a
large number of the words and phrases which he
employs recall the best writers of antiquity. His
compositions exhibit signs of much care in production,
notably the treatise <i>On Nature</i>
(<span title="peri Physe&ocirc;s" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &Phi;&#8059;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;</span>)
and the two Easter letters, to the Alexandrians and
to Hierax (pp.
<a href="#Page_70">70</a> and
<a href="#Page_73">73</a>).
Here, and to a somewhat
less degree in the letter to Hermammon
(<a href="#Page_65">pp. 65 ff.</a>),
he writes in a more rhetorical and elaborate manner than
in most of the other fragments which are extant, but
even in these passages he is seldom fantastic, or stilted,
or obscure; whilst in pure narrative or simple description
(<i>e. g.</i> in the letters which record his own or others&rsquo;
sufferings and in the treatise <i>On the Promises</i>
(<span title="peri Epangeli&ocirc;n" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &#7960;&pi;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&#8182;&nu;</span>)),
his language could hardly be more unaffected or better chosen.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Dionysius as Interpreter of Scripture</span></h3>
<p>23. To what extent did Dionysius accept the principles
and methods of Origen, especially in the matter
of Biblical criticism and interpretation? The evidence,
such as it is, is rather doubtful and conflicting.
It is somewhat ominous that after the death of
Bishop Demetrius, whose denunciations had caused
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the master&rsquo;s removal from Alexandria and his retirement
to C&aelig;sarea, we hear of no effort on the part of
Dionysius or of any other pupil to obtain his recall.
This certainly suggests that, great as their regard and
respect for him as a man and a scholar may have been,
they either felt themselves powerless to reinstate him,
or else considered his views and methods of advocating
them detrimental to the welfare of the Church at large.
On the other hand, it is pleasing to remember that
Dionysius wrote an epistle to his old teacher on the
subject of martyrdom, which we may presume was
designed to comfort him during his imprisonment at
Tyre. We learn, too, on somewhat late authority that
after Origen&rsquo;s death Dionysius wrote a letter to
Theotecnus, Bishop of C&aelig;sarea, extolling his
master&rsquo;s virtues. The chief methodical comments on
the Bible, of the authenticity of which we may be certain,
are those contained in the fragments of the treatise
<i>On the Promises</i>
(<span title="peri Epangeli&ocirc;n" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &#7960;&pi;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&#8182;&nu;</span>),
reproduced on
<a href="#Page_82">pp. 82 ff.</a>
This was a direct reply to the <i>Refutation of Allegorists</i>
(<span title="Elenchos All&ecirc;gorist&ocirc;n" class="g">&#7964;&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&chi;&omicron;&sigma; &#7944;&lambda;&lambda;&eta;&gamma;&omicron;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#8182;&nu;</span>),
in which Nepos of Arsenoe had thought to support his grossly
materialistic views of the Millennium by the Revelation of
S. John the Divine. As the title suggests, this work
had, no doubt, attacked Origen&rsquo;s fondness for the
allegorical interpretation of Scripture, and especially
on the subject of the Millennium, and therefore we may
with some amount of certainty infer that Dionysius
in his refutation of Nepos would accept Origen&rsquo;s
methods as a commentator. But the extracts preserved
by Eusebius deal almost wholly with the
authorship and textual criticism, and so give no
proper clue as to his method of interpreting the
subject-matter of the book.</p>
<p>In the letter to Basilides
(<a href="#Page_76">pp. 76 ff.</a>)
the requirements
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
of the case do not call for a style of interpretation
which would bring out either a correspondence or a
disagreement with Origen&rsquo;s methods, except so far
as it is marked by the frank and free exercise of
critical judgment. The commentary on the <i>Beginning
of Ecclesiastes</i>, if it is, as seems likely, in part
the work of Dionysius, is not inconsistent in style of
treatment with a general acceptance of his master&rsquo;s
position. Procopius of Gaza, however, ranks him
among the opponents of the allegorical school of
interpreters, stating that it was in this very work
that Dionysius attacked his master, and a short extract
which has been assigned to it by Pitra (<i>Spic.
Solesm.</i>, i, 17) is distinctly less allegorical in treatment
than the rest: it runs as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On <span class="scripRef">Eccles. iv. 9, 10</span>:
&lsquo;Two are better than one,&rsquo;
etc. As we understand this literally, we do not
admit those who accept the interpretation of the
statements as referring to the soul and the body; for
it is by no means justified, seeing that the soul has
the entire control over the ruling and governing both
of itself and of the body, whereas the body is the
bondman of the soul, subservient and enthralled to
it in all its decisions. If, then, the soul be inclined
to what is mean and evil, and become careless of
better thoughts and considerations, the body is
unable to restore it and lead it back to higher things:
for that is not natural to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is also another short extract (on
<span class="scripRef">Gen. ii. 8, 9</span><sup><a id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></sup>) attributed to our
author, which is non-allegorical
in its treatment. The evidence therefore is inconclusive
on this point: for though Jerome also mentions
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Dionysius as a commentator on the Bible three
times in his letters, he throws no further light on the
question.<sup><a id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the subject of Inspiration we have no ground
for thinking that Dionysius took up an independent
position.<sup><a id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></sup> He introduces his Biblical quotation
with the phrases current amongst early Christian writers.</p>
<p>The general impression therefore left upon the
reader is that Dionysius reverted to the more sober
methods of interpreting Scripture that prevailed
throughout the Church of his day as a whole, though
he approached his master&rsquo;s theories in his usual sympathetic
spirit and availed himself of much that was
valuable in them.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">His Place in the Church Kalendar</span></h3>
<p>24. We hear of a Church dedicated to S. Denys in
Alexandria at the beginning of the fourth century,
which was destroyed by fire in a tumult in the time
of Athanasius. October 3 and November 17 are the
two most usual dates for his Commemoration in the
Kalendar, the former date more especially in the East, where he
is honoured as &ldquo;a holy martyr.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="sc">Concluding Remarks</span></h3>
<p>25. The foregoing sketch is sufficient to show that, as
a man of action and a ruler of the Church, Dionysius&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
personality is no less striking than as a student, a
writer and a thinker. He was clearly a strong yet
conciliatory administrator of his province as Bishop
of Alexandria, just as he had been a competent and
successful teacher and director of sacred studies as
head of the Catechetical Schools&mdash;one who in each
capacity carried on and maintained the great traditions
which he inherited from S. Mark and his successors,
from Pant&aelig;nus, Clement and Origen. And
not only at home and within his own jurisdiction, as
we have seen, did he worthily &ldquo;magnify his office&rdquo;
and &ldquo;make full proof of his ministry&rdquo;; for he made
his influence for good felt throughout Christendom.
Bishops and clergy from all parts naturally turned to
him in their difficulties for advice and guidance; and
it is impossible not to feel that his wonderful breadth
of judgment and his love of conciliation were of the
greatest value to the Church of the third century,
and will remain a model for imitation to each succeeding
age. Men will always be tempted, as they
were in that century, to speak strongly and to act
vehemently where their spiritual beliefs are involved,
and we may pray that God will never fail to raise
up amongst the rulers of His Church men of the type
of S. Denys the Great of Alexandria.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Bibliography</span></h3>
<p>26. The first attempt at making a full collection of
our author&rsquo;s remains was undertaken by Simon de
Magistris, whose edition was published at Rome in
1796. Routh (<i>Reliqui&aelig; Sacr&aelig;</i>, tom. iii. and iv.;
Oxford, 1846) and Migne (<i>Patr. Gr&aelig;c.</i> tom. x.) published
considerable portions with Latin notes, while
Gallandius (<i>Bibliotheca vett. patrum</i>, app. to vol. xiv.),
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Pitra, Mai and (more recently) Holl in vol. v. of <i>Texte
und Untersuchungen</i> (<i>neue Folge</i>) have printed a
number of fragments from various sources and of
very varying degrees of probable authenticity.</p>
<p>The earliest list of Dionysius&rsquo;s literary productions,
except the scattered references to be found in the
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>
of Eusebius, is that of Jerome
(<i>de viris illustribus</i>, 69),
which more or less tallies with
what we gather from Eusebius. The student will,
however, find a complete modern list of them, together
with other valuable matter, in Harnack, <i>Altchrist. Lit.</i>,
vol. i. pp. 409-27, and in Bardenhewer, <i>Altkirch. Lit.</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 167-91: the account in Kr&uuml;ger, <i>Early
Christian Literature</i> (Eng. Trans.) is much shorter.
Several compositions mentioned by Eusebius and
Jerome are only known to us by name, unless some of
the short extracts attributed to Dionysius come from
one or other of them, and the contents of them are
almost wholly matter for conjecture. The most important
of these is perhaps the
<span title="epistol&ecirc; diakonik&ecirc; dia Hippolytou" class="g">&#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&lambda;&#8053; &delta;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8052; &delta;&iota;&#8048; &#7993;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&#8059;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>
(Eus., <i>H. E.</i> vi. 45),
because of the various theories which have been put forward
about it. Dom Morin (<i>Revue B&eacute;n&eacute;dictine</i>,
xvii., 1900), for instance, suggested that Rufinus&rsquo;s
translation of the doubtful epithet
(<span title="diakonik&ecirc;" class="g">&delta;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8053;</span>)
being <i>de ministeriis</i>, it was none
other than the <i>Canons of Hippolytus</i>, and that the
Canons were afterwards attributed to the church-writer,
Hippolytus, through a mistaken identification
of the unknown bearer of Dionysius&rsquo;s missive with
the well-known author; but the theory has not met
with much acceptance since, and the discussion has
of late died down, quite different views being now
held about the Canons of Hippolytus.</p>
<p>It may also be mentioned that several fragments in
Syriac and in Armenian are attributed to Dionysius,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
but only three of these, in the former language, appear to be
genuine: one is a translation of the letter to Novatian
(<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>),
and the two others are, whether rightly or wrongly, thought
to be part of the Letter to Stephanus on Baptism, and will be
found as &sect;&sect; 2 and 3 of it on
<a href="#Page_53">pp. 53 ff.</a></p>
<p>The article on
Dionysius
in Smith&rsquo;s
<i>Dictionary of Christian Biography</i>
is by Dr. Westcott, and, though
not very full, is, it is needless to say, worthy of being
consulted.</p>
<p>Three German books on our author will also be found useful,
though not very recent: viz.
F&ouml;rster, <i>de doctrin. et sententiis Dionysii</i>, Berolini, 1865;
Dittrich, <i>Dionysius der Grosse</i>, Freiburg, i.B., 1867; and
Roch, <i>Dionysius der Grosse &uuml;ber die Natur</i>, Leipzig, 1882.
Of these the second is the most important
for the general student.</p>
<p>Dr. Salmond produced a serviceable translation of
the fragments in 1871
(T. &amp; T. Clark&rsquo;s series, Edinburgh),
and since then we have had Dr. Gifford&rsquo;s (in
his scholarly edition of Eus., <i>Pr&aelig;par. Evang.</i>, Oxford,
1903), of such as there appear.</p>
<p>For the general history of the period much valuable
help will be found in Archbishop Benson&rsquo;s <i>Cyprian</i>,
London, 1897; P. Allard, <i>Histoire des Pers&eacute;cutions</i>,
vols. ii. and iii., Paris, 1886, and Aub&eacute;, <i>L&rsquo;Eglise et
l&rsquo;Etat dans la 2de moiti&eacute; du 3me Si&egrave;cle</i>.</p>
<p>A full collection of all the genuine and doubtful
extracts appeared in the series of <i>Cambridge Patristic
Texts</i>, with introductions and notes by the present
editor, in 1904.</p>

<h2 id="c3">LETTERS</h2>
<h3><span class="sc">To Fabian, Bishop of Antioch</span>
<br /><span class="src">(Eus., <i>H. E.</i> vi. 41, 42, and 44)</span></h3>
<p>(1) The persecution did not begin amongst us with
the Imperial edict; for it anticipated that by a whole
year. And the prophet and poet of evil to this city, whoever he
was,<sup><a id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></sup> was beforehand in
moving and exciting the heathen crowds against us, rekindling
their zeal for the national superstitions. So they
being aroused by him and availing themselves of all
lawful authority for their unholy doings, conceived
that the only piety, the proper worship of their gods
was this&mdash;to thirst for our blood. First, then, they
carried off an old man, Metras, and bade him utter
impious words,<sup><a id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></sup>
and when he refused they beat his
body with sticks and stabbed his face and eyes with
sharp bulrushes as they led him into the outskirts
of the city and there stoned him. Then they led a
believer named Quinta to the idol-house and tried to
make her kneel down, and, when she turned away in
disgust, they bound her by the feet and hauled her
right through the city over the rough pavement, the
big stones bruising her poor body, and at the same
time beat her till they reached the same spot, and
there stoned her. Thereupon they all with one
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
consent made a rush on the houses of the believers,
and, falling each upon those whom they recognized
as neighbours, plundered, harried and despoiled
them, setting aside the more valuable of their possessions
and casting out into the streets and burning
the cheaper things and such as were made of wood,
till they produced the appearance of a city devastated
by the enemy. But the brethren gave way and submitted
and accepted the plundering of their possessions
with joy like unto those of whom Paul also
testified.<sup><a id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></sup>
And I know not if any, save possibly a
single one who fell into their hands, up till now has
denied the Lord.</p>
<p>Another notable case was that of the aged virgin
Apollonia, whom they seized and knocked out all her
teeth, striking her on the jaws: then they made a
pyre before the city and threatened to burn her alive,
if she would not join them in uttering blasphemies.
But she asked for a brief respite, and being let go,
suddenly leapt into the fire and was devoured by the
flames. Sarapion, also, they caught in his own
house, and after outraging him with cruel tortures
and crushing all his limbs, they cast him headlong
from the upper storey.</p>
<p>And we could go by no high road, thoroughfare,
or byway, either by day or by night; for everywhere
and always there was a constant cry that any one who
did not utter words of blasphemy must be dragged off
and burnt.</p>
<p>And this state of things prevailed for some time,
till the revolution and civil
war<sup><a id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></sup>
occupied the attention
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of these unhappy men and turned on one another
their fury against us. And so we had a short breathing
space, as they found no leisure for raging against
us: but very soon the overthrow of the ruler who had
been not unfavourable to us<sup><a id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></sup> is announced, and our
grave fears of being attacked are renewed. And, in
fact, the edict arrived, which was itself almost to be
compared with that foretold by the Lord, well-nigh the
most terrible of all, so as to cause, if possible, even
the elect to stumble.<sup><a id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></sup> Nevertheless all were panic-stricken,
and numbers at once of those who were in
higher positions, some came forward in fear, and some
who held public posts were led by their official duties;
others, again, were brought in by those about them,
and when their names were called, approached the
impure and unholy sacrifices; pale and trembling in
some cases as if they were not going to sacrifice but
themselves become sacrifices and victims to the idols,
so that they incurred ridicule from the large crowd
that stood by, and proved themselves to be utter
cowards both in regard to death and in regard to
sacrificing, whilst others ran readily up to the altar,
making it plain by their forwardness that they had
not been Christians even before. About such the
Lord&rsquo;s prediction is most true that with difficulty
shall they be saved.<sup><a id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></sup> And of the
rest<sup><a id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></sup> some followed
one or other of the above, while others fled or were
captured: and of these last, again, some after going
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
as far as chains and imprisonment, and even after
being immured several days in certain cases, still,
before coming into court, forswore themselves; and
others, even after enduring some amount of torment,
failed at the last. But the steadfast and blessed
pillars of the Lord,<sup><a id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></sup>
being strengthened by Him and
receiving due and proportionate power and endurance
for the mighty Faith that was in them, proved themselves
admirable witnesses of His Kingdom.<sup><a id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></sup> Foremost
among them was Julian, a sufferer from gout,
unable to stand or walk; he was brought up with
two others, who carried him, of whom the one straightway
denied the Faith; the other, Cronion by name,
but surnamed Eunous (well-disposed), and the old
man Julian himself confessed the Lord and were
conveyed on camel&rsquo;s back, and scourged as they rode
right through the city&mdash;big though it be, as ye know&mdash;and
at last were burnt with fire unquenchable, whilst
all the people stood round. And a soldier who stood
by as they were carried along and protested against
those who insulted them was denounced and brought
up, to wit God&rsquo;s brave warrior Besas, and after heroic
conduct in the great war of piety was beheaded.
And yet another, a Libyan by race, who rightly and
happily was named Mauar (happy),<sup><a id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></sup> though the judge
urged him strongly to renounce the Faith, would not
give in, and so was burnt alive. After them Epimachus
and Alexander, when they had remained a
long time in bonds and had endured endless tortures
from the &ldquo;claws&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></sup> and scourges, were also consumed
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
with fire unquenchable. And with them four<sup><a id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></sup>
women: Ammonarion, a holy virgin, though the
judge tortured her vigorously for a long time because
she had declared beforehand that she would say
nothing that he bade her, kept true to her promise
and was led off to punishment; and of the rest there
was the aged and reverend Mercuria and Dionysia,
who, though she had many children, did not love
them above the Lord: these the Prefect was ashamed
to go on torturing in vain and be beaten by women,
and so they died by the sword without further tortures:
for the brave Ammonarion had exhausted all
their devices.</p>
<p>Then were delivered up three Egyptians: Heron,
Ater and Isidore, and with them Dioscorus, a lad of
about fifteen. And first of all the Prefect tried to
cajole the stripling with words, thinking he could
easily be won over, and then to force him by torments,
thinking he would soon give in, but Dioscorus
was neither persuaded nor forced. So the others
he cruelly lacerated, and when they, too, stood firm,
handed them over to the fire; but Dioscorus, who had
distinguished himself in public and had answered his
private questionings most wisely, he let off, saying that
he granted him a reprieve for repenting, on account of his age.
And now<sup><a id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></sup>
the godly Dioscorus is still with us, having waited for his longer
trial and his more determined conflict.</p>
<p>Another Egyptian, Nemesion, was falsely accused
of being an associate of brigands, but being accused
of that most untrue charge before the centurion, he
was then denounced as a Christian and came in
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
chains before the Prefect.<sup><a id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></sup> And he having most
unjustly maltreated him with twice as many tortures
and stripes as the brigands had received, burnt him
to death between them, being honoured, happy man,
by the example of Christ.<sup><a id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Again a whole quaternion of soldiers&mdash;Ammon,
Zenon, Ptolemy and Ingenuus, and an old man,
Theophilus, with them, were standing before the
judgment seat, whilst some one was being tried for
being a Christian, and when he showed signs of
denying the Faith they were so provoked as they
stood by, nodding their heads, and stretching out
their hands and making gestures with their bodies,
that they drew the general attention to themselves,
and then, before any could seize them, they leapt
upon the stand<sup><a id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></sup> of
their own accord, saying they
were Christians, so that the Prefect and his assessors
were frightened, and those who were being judged
seemed to take courage over what awaited them,
and their judges lost heart. So these soldiers walked
in brave procession from the court and rejoiced in
their witness (martyrdom), God giving them a
glorious triumph.<sup><a id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>(2) And many others in the cities and villages
were torn asunder by the heathen (Gentiles), one of
which I will mention as an example. Ischyrion
acted as steward to one of the authorities at a wage.
His employer bade him sacrifice, ill-treated him when
he refused, and on his persistence drove him forth
with insults: when he still stood his ground, he took
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
a big stick and killed him by driving it through his vital parts.
What need to mention the multitude of those who wandered in deserts
and mountains<sup><a id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></sup>
consumed by hunger and thirst and cold and diseases
and brigands and wild beasts? the survivors of
whom bear witness to their election and victory.<sup><a id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></sup>
Of these, also, I will bring forward one instance by
way of illustration. Ch&aelig;remon was the aged Bishop
of what is called Nilopolis. He fled to the Arabian hills<sup><a id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></sup> with his wife<sup><a id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></sup>
and never returned, nor were they ever seen again by the brethren,
who made long search, but found neither them nor their bodies.
And there were many who on those very Arabian hills were sold
into slavery by the barbarian Saracens,<sup><a id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></sup>
of whom some were with difficulty ransomed at high
sums, and others even yet have not been ransomed.
And these things I have described at length, brother,
not without purpose, but in order that thou mightest
know how many terrible things have taken place
amongst us, of which those who have had more
experience will know of more cases than I do.</p>
<p class="pcomment">Then shortly after he proceeds&mdash;</p>
<p>(3) Accordingly, the holy martyrs themselves, when still amongst
us, who are now the assessors of Christ and partners of His Kingdom,
sharing His judgments and decisions,<sup><a id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></sup> espoused the cause of
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
certain of the fallen brethren who had incurred the
charge of having done sacrifice, and seeing their
conversion and repentance and approving it as fit to
be accepted by Him who desireth not at all the death
of the sinner so much as his repentance,<sup><a id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></sup> received
them, summoned them to assemblies, introduced them
and admitted them to the prayers and feasts.<sup><a id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></sup> What,
then, do ye counsel us in these matters, brethren?
What ought we to do? Shall we acquiesce and
assent to them and maintain their decision and
concession and treat kindly those to whom they have
extended mercy? or shall we hold their judgment
wrong and set ourselves up as critics of their decision
and vex their kind hearts and reverse their
arrangement?</p>
<p class="pcomment">[A further extract on the subject of the lapsed]</p>
<p>I will set out the following single example that
happened amongst us. There was a certain aged
believer amongst us, Sarapion, who had lived blamelessly
for a long time but yielded to temptation.
This man often begged to be restored, but no one
heeded him; for he had sacrificed. But he fell
ill, and for three days in succession he remained
speechless and unconscious. Then recovering a
little on the fourth day, he called to him his nephew
and said: &ldquo;How long, my child, do ye keep me
back? hasten ye, I pray, and let me go speedily. Call
thou one of the elders (presbyters).&rdquo; After this he
became speechless again. The boy ran for the elder,
but it was night and he was ill and could not come.
Now I had given instructions that if those who were
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
departing life asked and especially when they chanced
to have made supplication even before, they should
be absolved in order that they might depart in good
hope; he gave the boy, therefore, a morsel of the
Eucharist, bidding him moisten it and drop it into
the old man&rsquo;s mouth. The lad went back with it.
When he drew near, before he entered, Sarapion
revived again and said: &ldquo;Hast come, child? The
presbyter could not come, but do thou quickly what
he bade thee, and let me go.&rdquo; So the boy moistened
it and dropped it into his mouth: and the other shortly
after swallowing it straightway gave up the ghost.
Was he not clearly sustained and kept alive until
he was absolved that, with his sin wiped out, he

<h3><span class="sc">To Germanus a Bishop</span>
<br /><span class="src">(Eus., <i>H. E.</i> vi. 40 and vii. 11)</span></h3>
<p>(1) Now before God I speak and He knoweth if I
lie;<sup><a id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></sup>
not at all on my own judgment nor yet without
Divine guidance did I take flight, but on a former
occasion also as soon as ever the persecution under
Decius was set up,<sup><a id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></sup>
Sabinus<sup><a id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></sup> sent a
<i>frumentarius</i><sup><a id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></sup> to
seek me; and I awaited his arrival at my house for
four days, while he went round searching everywhere,
the streams, the roads and the fields, where he suspected
me to hide or go, but he never lighted on my
house, being held by blindness: for he did not believe
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
I should stay at home under pursuit. And hardly after the
four days when God bade me remove and unexpectedly made a
way for me, I and the boys<sup><a id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></sup> and
many of the brethren went out together. And this
was ordered by the Providence of God, as after events
have shown, in which perchance we have been useful
to some.</p>
<p class="pcomment">Further on he proceeds&mdash;</p>
<p>(2) For about sunset I with my companions having
fallen into the hands of the soldiers, was taken to
Taposiris, but Timotheus<sup><a id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></sup>
by the Providence of God
happened not to be present nor to be caught elsewhere.
But arriving afterwards, he found the house
empty and servants guarding it, and us carried off
prisoners.</p>
<p class="pcomment">And further on&mdash;</p>
<p>(3) And what is the manner of His wonderful dispensation?
for only the truth shall be spoken. One
of the rustics met Timotheus as he was fleeing and
troubled,<sup><a id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></sup>
and inquired the reason of his haste. And
he told the truth, and when the other heard it (now
he was going to a marriage revel: for it is their
custom to pass the whole night at such gatherings),
he entered and informed those who were reclining at
table. And they with one consent as if at a signal
all arose and came running at great speed and fell
upon us with loud cries, and when the soldiers who
were guarding us straightway took to flight, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
came upon us just as we were reclining on the bare
bedsteads. And I indeed, God wot, taking them at
first to be bandits who had come for plunder and
ravage, remained on the couch where I was, undressed
save for my linen under-garment,<sup><a id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></sup>
and began to offer them the rest of my raiment which was
at my side. But they bade me rise and go out as quickly as I
could. And then I, understanding why they had
come, cried out begging and praying them to depart
and leave us, and if they would do us a good turn,
I besought them to forestall those who had carried
me off and cut off my head themselves. And while
I thus cried, as they know who shared and took part
in everything, they raised me by force, and when I
let myself down on my back to the ground, they took
and led me out, dragging me by the arms and legs.
And there followed me those who had been witnesses
of all this, Gaius, Faustus, Peter and Paul, and they
also helped to carry me out of the township in their
arms, and then putting me on a barebacked ass, led
me away.</p>
<p class="pcomment">[Another extract from the same letter given by
Eusebius in another part of his History, and referring
to a somewhat later period in Dionysius&rsquo;s life]</p>
<p>(4) I am really in danger of falling into much
foolishness<sup><a id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></sup> and want of right
feeling through being
compelled of necessity to narrate God&rsquo;s wondrous
dispensation concerning us. But since &ldquo;it is good,&rdquo;
it says,<sup><a id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></sup>
&ldquo;to keep close the secret of a king but
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
glorious to reveal the works of God,&rdquo; I will come to
close quarters with our violent accuser, Germanus. I came before
&AElig;milian<sup><a id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></sup> not
alone; for there followed with me my fellow-presbyter<sup><a id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></sup> Maximus, and deacons
Faustus, Eusebius and Ch&aelig;remon. And one of the
brethren who was present from Rome came in with
us. Now &AElig;milian did not say to me at the start,
&ldquo;Do not summon&rdquo; (the brethren for public worship):
for that was superfluous and the last thing (to insist
on), since he was going back to the very beginning
of the matter. For the question was not about
summoning others but about not being Christians
ourselves, and it was from this that he bade us desist,
thinking that if I should change my mind, the others
would follow me. And I answered not unsuitably
nor yet very differently from the words: &ldquo;We
ought to obey God rather than
men,&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></sup>
but I testified outright that I worship the only God and none
other, nor will I ever alter nor desist from being a Christian.
Upon this he bade us go away to a village on the
borders of the desert named Cephro. Listen then
to what was said on both sides as it was (officially)
recorded: Dionysius, Faustus, Maximus, Marcellus<sup><a id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></sup>
and Ch&aelig;remon being brought in, &AElig;milian the Prefect
said: &ldquo;In the course of conversation also<sup><a id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></sup> I
described to you the clemency which our Sovereigns<sup><a id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></sup>
have displayed towards you. For they gave you
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
opportunity of being liberated if you would adopt
a natural line of conduct and worship the gods who
protect the Empire and give up those who are contrary
to nature. What say ye then to this? for I
do not expect you will be ungrateful for their clemency
when they invite you to a better course.&rdquo; Dionysius
answered: &ldquo;It is not a fact that all men worship all
gods, for each worships certain whom he believes in.
So with us, we worship and adore the One God, the
Creator of all things, who has entrusted the Empire
also to the most religious Emperors, Valerian and Gallienus;
and to Him we pray<sup><a id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></sup> without ceasing
for their Empire that it may abide unshaken.&rdquo;
&AElig;milian the Prefect said, &ldquo;But who prevents you
from worshipping him also, if he be god, with the
natural gods? for you were ordered to worship gods
and those which all know.&rdquo; Dionysius answered:
&ldquo;We worship none other but Him.&rdquo; &AElig;milian the
Prefect said to them: &ldquo;I observe that you together
are both ungrateful and insensible of the leniency
of our Emperors. Wherefore ye shall not be in this
city but shall be dismissed to the parts of Libya and
stay in a place called Cephro, which I have chosen
at the bidding of our Emperors. And both you and
others will be absolutely forbidden either to hold
meetings or to enter the cemeteries so-called.<sup><a id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></sup> And if
any one were to appear not to have arrived at the
place I have ordered or were found at any assembly,
he will do so at his own risk. For the necessary
penalty will not be wanting. Be off therefore where
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
ye were bidden.&rdquo; So he hurried me away even
though I was sick, granting me not a day&rsquo;s respite.
What leisure, then, had I to call assemblies or not?<sup><a id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p class="pcomment">Further on he says&mdash;</p>
<p>(5) But we did not abstain even from the visible
assembling of ourselves together in the Lord&rsquo;s
presence, but those who were in the city (Alexandria)
I the more earnestly urged to assemble, as if I were still
with them, being absent in the body, as it says, but present
in the spirit.<sup><a id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a></sup>
And at Cephro also a
large number of the Church were sojourning with us,
consisting of the brethren who had followed us from
the city or were present from other parts of Egypt.
There, too, the Lord opened us a door for the
word.<sup><a id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a></sup>
And at first we were pursued and stoned, but later
not a few of the Gentiles left their idols and turned
to God. Thus the word was first sown through us
in their hearts who had not previously received it.
And as it were for this cause God having led us to
them, led us away again when we had fulfilled this
ministry.<sup><a id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a></sup>
For &AElig;milian wished, as it seemed, to transfer
us to rougher and more Libyan-like parts, and
bade those who were scattered in every direction to
draw together to the Mareotis, assigning to each party
one of the villages of the district, but us he put more
on the road so that we should be the first to be
arrested. For he evidently managed and arranged
so that he might have us easy of capture whenever
he wished to seize us. And as for me, when I was
ordered to depart to Cephro, I did not even know
in what direction the place lay, hardly having heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
so much as the name before; and yet I went off
willingly and without trouble. But when it was
told me that they would remove me to the parts of
Colluthion, all who were present know how I was
affected. For here I will accuse myself. At first
I was vexed and took it very ill. For though the
place happened to be better known and more familiar
to us, yet people said it was devoid of brethren and
respectable folk, being exposed to the annoyances of
wayfarers and the attacks of robbers. But I found
consolation when the brethren reminded me that it
is nearer to the city, and that, while Cephro gave
much opportunity of intercourse with brethren from
Egypt in general, so that one could draw congregations
from a wider area, yet at Colluthion we should
more constantly enjoy the sight of those who were
really loved and most intimate and dear. For they
would be able to come and stay the night and there
would be district-meetings as is the case with outlying
suburbs.<sup><a id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a></sup>
And so it turned out.</p>
<p class="pcomment">And lower down again he writes this about what
had happened to him&mdash;</p>
<p>(6) Many indeed are the confessions of faith over
which Germanus prides himself: many are the things
which he has to mention as having happened to him.
Can he reckon up as many in his own case as I can in
mine&mdash;condemnations, confiscations, sales by public
auction, spoiling of one&rsquo;s possessions, loss of dignities,
despisings of worldly honour, contempt of commendations
by Prefects and Councils and of opponents&rsquo;
threats, endurance of clamourings and dangers and
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
persecutions and wanderings and tribulations and
much affliction, such as are the things which have
happened unto me under Decius and Sabinus and up
to the present time under &AElig;milian? But where
did Germanus appear? What talk was there of him?
However, I withdraw from the much foolishness into
which I am falling through Germanus; wherefore I
refrain from giving a detailed account of events to

<p>If it was against thy will, as thou sayest, that thou wast
promoted,<sup><a id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></sup> thou wilt prove this by retiring of
thine own accord. It were good to suffer anything and
everything so to escape dividing the Church of God. And
martyrdom<sup><a id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></sup>
to avoid schism is no less glorious than martyrdom to avoid
idolatry. Nay, it is to my mind greater. In one case a man is a
martyr for his own single soul&rsquo;s sake. But this is for the
whole Church. Even now wast thou to persuade or constrain the
brethren to come to one mind, thy true deed<sup><a id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></sup> were greater than thy fall. This will
not be reckoned to thee, the other will be lauded.
And if thou shouldest be powerless to sway disobedient
spirits, save, save thine own

the heretics.<sup><a id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a></sup> And observe the importance
of the matter. For decrees had really been passed
about it in the largest synods of the bishops,<sup><a id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a></sup> as I
am informed, so that those who come over from
heretical bodies, after a course of instruction, are
washed and cleansed from the defilement of the old
and unclean leaven.<sup><a id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></sup>
About all this also I have written asking him for information.</p>
<p>(2) To our beloved fellow-presbyters also, Dionysius
and Philemon, who had formerly sided with Stephanus
and were correspondents of mine on the same matter,
I have written briefly the first time and more fully
now.<sup><a id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>(3) The teaching which is now at work in Ptolemais of
Pentapolis,<sup><a id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></sup> is impious, full of blasphemy about
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the Almighty God and Father<sup><a id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></sup> of our Lord Jesus
Christ and full of unbelief about His only begotten

the First-born of all creation,<sup><a id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a></sup>
the Incarnate Word, and displays want of perception concerning
the Holy Spirit. And therefore, when both official
communications from both parties arrived and some
of the brethren sought personal interviews with me,
I wrote what I could<sup><a id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a></sup> by the Divine assistance and
gave a somewhat methodical explanation of the
matter, a copy of which I have sent you.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">To Philemon</span>
<br /><span class="src">(Eus., <i>H. E.</i> vii. 7)</span>
<br /><span class="src">(<i>The third on the same subject</i>)</span></h3>
<p>(1) I read both the critical researches and the traditional
treatises<sup><a id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a></sup> of the heretics,
defiling my soul a little with their abominable opinions and yet
gaining this advantage from them, that I could
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
refute them for myself and abhor them much more
thoroughly. And indeed when a certain brother
among the presbyters tried to restrain me and
frighten me from contaminating myself with the
mire of their iniquity (he said I should ruin my soul,
and, as I perceived, there was truth in what he said),
a heaven-sent vision<sup><a id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></sup>
came and strengthened me,
and words came to me which expressly ordered me
thus: &ldquo;Read all that may come to thy hands: for
thou art competent to sift and test everything, and that was the
original reason<sup><a id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></sup>
of thy accepting the
Faith.&rdquo; I acknowledged the vision as in agreement
with the apostolic voice which says to the more able:
&ldquo;Approve yourselves bankers of repute.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a></sup></p>
<p>(2) This cause and rule I received from our blessed
Father<sup><a id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a></sup> Heraclas. For those that came
over from the heretics, although they had apostatized from the
Church&mdash;or rather had not even done that but were
informed against as resorting to some heretical teacher,
though still reputed members of our congregations&mdash;these
he repelled from the Church, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
did not restore them at their request until they had
publicly and fully stated all that they had heard
among those who set themselves against us; and then
he admitted them without requiring them to be
re-baptized: for they had received that holy gift
already.</p>
<p>(3) I have learnt this also, that the brethren in
Africa<sup><a id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a></sup>
did not introduce this practice (of re-baptism)
now for the first time, but it was also adopted some
time ago among our predecessors as Bishops, in the
most populous churches and well-attended synods of
the brethren, viz. in Iconium and Synnada,<sup><a id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a></sup> and I cannot bring myself
to reverse their decisions and involve them in strife and
controversy. For &ldquo;thou shalt not remove,&rdquo; it says,
&ldquo;thy neighbour&rsquo;s boundaries, which thy fathers
set.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a></sup></p>

<p>I truly desire counsel, brother, and ask an opinion
from you, being afraid lest after all I am wrong in
my treatment of a case that has come before me as
follows&mdash;</p>
<p>One who is reckoned faithful among the brethren
who meet together, of old standing, having been a
member even before my ordination (as Bishop), and
I fancy even before the appointment of the blessed
Heraclas, had been present at a recent baptism and
heard the questions and answers (in that service).
He came to me weeping and bemoaning himself and
falling at my feet, confessing and protesting that
the baptism he had received among the heretics was
not this, nor had anything in common with it: for
that was full of impiety and blasphemies:<sup><a id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a></sup> and he
said that he was now sore pricked in the soul and
had no courage even to lift up his eyes to God,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
because he had started with such unholy words and
rites, and so he begged to obtain this thorough means
of purification and acceptance and grace. But this
I did not venture to do, saying that his so long being
in communion with us was sufficient for the purpose.
For as he had heard the Giving of Thanks (Eucharist)

and approach for the receiving of the Holy Things

grieve, and shrinks from approaching the Table and

believing that they will gain relief and lightening of
punishment there, if they be loosed here&mdash;for these
the approval of the Lord is true and assured&mdash;these,
too, it is part of the Divine mercy to send on their
way free. If, however, they afterwards continue to
live, it does not appear to me consistent to bind them
again and load them with their sins. For when once
absolved and reconciled to God, and pronounced
again to be partakers of Divine grace and dispatched
as free to appear before the Lord,<sup><a id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a></sup> so long as nothing
wrong has been done by them in the meantime to
bring them back into bondage for their sins were
most unreasonable. Shall we after that<sup><a id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a></sup> impose on
God the limits of our judgment, to be kept by Him
while we observe them not ourselves, making parade of the goodness
of the Lord<sup><a id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a></sup>
but withholding our own? Nevertheless if any one, after recovery,
should show himself in need of further treatment, we counsel
him, of his own accord, to humble and abase and lower
himself, with a view to his own improvement and
also to what is seemly in the eyes of the brethren and
irreproachable before those without.<sup><a id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></sup> If he consent
to this, he will be the gainer: but, if he should object
and refuse, then no doubt that will be a sufficient
ground for a second exclusion.</p>

Christ in His goodness seeks when wandering upon
the mountains, and calls to Himself when fleeing, and
lays upon His shoulders when found at last,<sup><a id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a></sup> him we

not adopt so evil a counsel for our own sake, nor
drive the sword into our own heart. For they that
endeavour to injure or, on the other hand, to benefit
others, may not altogether have the effect they
desired upon them, but they do bring about good or
evil for themselves and replenish their store either of heavenly
virtues or of undisciplined affections. And these taking good
angels as their companions and fellow-travellers,<sup><a id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a></sup> both here and hereafter, in all

the most blessed inheritances for eternity and will
ever be with God, the greatest good of all; and those
will forfeit at once the peace of God and their own
peace, and both here and after death will be handed
over to tormenting demons. Let us then not repel
those who return, but gladly welcome them and

doing so. Nevertheless, God gives them some respite

<p>(1) Even Gallus<sup><a id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a></sup>
did not know the flaw in Decius&rsquo;s
policy, nor did he foresee what it was that upset him,
but stumbled over the same stone that was right
before his eyes. For, though his reign was prospering
and things were going according to his mind, he
drove into exile the holy men who were interceding
with God for his peace and health, with the effect
that with them he drove out also their prayers on
his behalf.</p>
<p class="pcomment">So far on that point, and then again he discourses
about Valerian in the same letter&mdash;</p>

him authority and forty-two months.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a></sup> And both
these things are to be wondered at in the case of
Valerian,<sup><a id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a></sup> and of them it is
especially to be observed how his prosperity lasted so long as he
was gentle and well-disposed towards the men of God.<sup><a id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a></sup> For
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
none of the Emperors before him were so kindly and
favourably affected towards them, not even those
who were said to have been openly Christians,<sup><a id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a></sup>
as he manifestly was, receiving them at the beginning
in a most familiar and friendly spirit: indeed, his
whole house was filled with devout persons and was
a veritable Church of God.<sup><a id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></sup> But he was persuaded
to abandon this treatment by that tutor and chief ruler of
Egyptian magicians,<sup><a id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a></sup>
who instructed him
to slay or persecute, as adversaries and hinderers of
his vile and detestable sorcerers, the pure and holy
persons, who are and were able to confound the
devices of accursed demons by being present and seen
and merely breathing on them and uttering words,<sup><a id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a></sup>
while he also incited him to perform unholy rites
and detestable juggleries and abominable sacrifices
such as the killing of wretched boys and the slaying
of unhappy fathers&rsquo; children and the dividing of
new-born entrails asunder and the cutting up and
mutilating of bodies which are God&rsquo;s creation,<sup><a id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a></sup>
in the hope that such doings would bring them Divine favour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p class="pcomment">And to this he adds as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>(3) Fine offerings at all events did Macrianus make
to them (sc. the demons) to propitiate them for the
Empire which he hoped for, when, in his former
position as so-called officer in charge of the Emperor&rsquo;s general
(<span title="katholou" class="g">&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8057;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>)
accounts he entertained no reasonable
(<span title="eulogon" class="g">&epsilon;&#8020;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&nu;</span>)
nor catholic
(<span title="katholikon" class="g">&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&kappa;&#8057;&nu;</span>)
sentiments,<sup><a id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a></sup>
but fell under the prophet&rsquo;s curse, who says: &ldquo;Woe to
those who prophesy out of their own heart and see not the general
(<span title="to katholou" class="g">&tau;&#8056; &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8057;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>)
view.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a></sup> For he did
not understand the workings of Universal
(<span title="katholou" class="g">&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8057;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>)
Providence,<sup><a id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a></sup> nor suspect the approach of Judgment
on the part of Him who is before all things and
through all things and over all things.<sup><a id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a></sup> Wherefore
he has become also the enemy of His universal
(<span title="katholik&ecirc;s" class="g">&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&kappa;&#8134;&sigmaf;</span>)
Church and has alienated and estranged
himself from God&rsquo;s mercy and banished himself as
far as possible from his own salvation, verifying in
this his personal name.<sup><a id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a></sup></p>
<p class="pcomment">And again further on he says&mdash;</p>
<p>(4) For Valerian, through being persuaded to this
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
policy by him, exposed himself to insults and injuries
according to that which was said to Isaiah: &ldquo;And these
men chose their ways and their abominations which
their soul desired, and I will choose their mockings
and will recompense them their
sins.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a></sup></p>
<p>But this man (Macrianus) in his mad lust after
imperial power for which he had no qualifications,
being unable to deck his own crippled body with the
imperial robes, put forward his two sons, who thus
became liable for their father&rsquo;s sins.<sup><a id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a></sup> For the prophecy
clearly applies to them which God spake:
&ldquo;visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation of them that
hate me.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></sup>
For he brought upon his sons&rsquo; heads his
own evil desires in which he had succeeded and involved
them in the consequences of his own wickedness
and hatred of God.<sup><a id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></sup></p>
<p class="pcomment">Then there is a section in which he refers to the
peaceful times under Gallienus&mdash;</p>
<p>(5) So after thus inciting one of the Emperors before
him and attacking the other, he speedily vanished
with all his family, root and branch,<sup><a id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a></sup> whilst Gallienus was proclaimed and
acknowledged by all, being at
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
once the old and the new Emperor, having preceded
the usurpers and remaining after them. For, in
accordance with that which was spoken to the prophet
Isaiah, &ldquo;behold the things predicted from the beginning
have come to pass, and new things which will now
arise.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a></sup> For as a cloud having overcast
the sun&rsquo;s rays and screened them for a while shades it and
shows itself in its stead, and then when the cloud has passed
off or been dissipated the sun which was shining
before emerges and shines forth again, so it is with
Macrianus; after coming forward and gaining access
for himself to the imperial power which belonged to
Gallienus, he ceases to be, since he was of no account,
and the other resumes the position he had before.
And the Empire, having cast off, as it were, its old
age and purged itself of its former badness, now
bursts into greater splendour, is seen and heard from
afar and pervades the whole world.</p>
<p class="pcomment">Then in due order he indicates the date of this
letter in these words&mdash;</p>
<p>(6) And once more it occurs to me to consider the
days and years of this period of the Empire. For I
observe that the ungodly persons (I have mentioned)
after a short period of honourable mention have
lost their good name, but (Gallienus) who was more
righteous and loved God better,<sup><a id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a></sup> having completed

<br /><span class="src">(Eus., <i>H. E.</i> vii. 22)</span>
<br /><span class="src">(<i>Part of another Easter Letter</i>)</span></h3>
<p>(1) Other men would not think the present a time
for &ldquo;keeping festival: nor, indeed, is this nor any
other such a time to them; I speak not of times
obviously sorrowful, but even of such as they might
consider most joyful. In these days there are lamentations
everywhere, and all are mourning: wailings
resound through the city by reason of the number
of the dead and the dying day by day. For, as it is
written about the firstborn of the Egyptians, so now
also &ldquo;a great cry arose: for there is not a house in
which there is not one
dead.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a></sup>
I would, indeed, there were but one; for the things that have
before now befallen us were truly many and grievous.<sup><a id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a></sup> First of
all they drove us into exile and we kept the feast
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
then too by ourselves, persecuted and harried to death
by all, and every place where each particular affliction
befel us became the scene of our festal assembly,
open country, desert, ship, inn or prison, and our
perfect<sup><a id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a></sup>
martyrs spent the brightest of all feasts,
being entertained in heaven above. But after this
war and famine seized us, which we endured in
common with the Gentiles, having undergone alone
all the injuries they had inflicted on us and then
having to share in the evils they wrought on one
another and suffered: and once more we rejoiced in
the peace of Christ, which He has given to us alone.
But now after we and they had obtained a very brief
respite, this pestilence has overtaken us, which is
to them a more fearful thing than all former fears
and more terrible than any calamity whatever, and
to quote an expression of an historian of their own,<sup><a id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a></sup> &ldquo;a thing which alone has
exceeded all men&rsquo;s expectation,&rdquo;
while to us it was not so much that as a discipline
and a testing no less severe than any of the
rest: for it did not spare us, though it attacked the
Gentiles in great force.</p>
<p class="pcomment">To this he adds as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>(2) At all events most of the brethren through
their love and brotherly affection for us spared not
themselves nor abandoned one another, but without
regard to their own peril visited those who fell sick,
diligently looking after and ministering to them and
cheerfully shared their fate with them, being infected
with the disease from them and willingly involving
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
themselves in their troubles. Not a few also, after
nursing others back to recovery, died themselves,
taking death over from them and thus fulfilling in
very deed the common saying, which is taken always
as a note of mere good feeling; for in their departure
they became their expiatory substitutes.<sup><a id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></sup>
At all events, the very pick of our brethren lost their lives
in this way, both priests and deacons and some highly
praised ones from among the laity, so that this
manner of dying does not seem far removed from
martyrdom, being the outcome of much piety and
stalwart faith. So, too, taking up the bodies of the
saints on their arms and breasts, closing their eyes
and shutting their mouths, bearing them on their
shoulders and laying them out for burial, clinging
to them, embracing them, washing them, decking
them out, they not long after had the same services
rendered to them; for many of the survivors followed
in their train. But the Gentiles behaved quite differently:
those who were beginning to fall sick they thrust away, and
their dearest they fled from, or cast them half dead into the
roads: unburied bodies they treated as vile refuse;<sup><a id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></sup> for they
tried to avoid the spreading and communication of the fatal
disease, difficult as it was to escape for all their scheming.</p>

<br /><span class="src">(<i>Part of another Easter Letter</i>)</span></h3>
<p>But what is there surprising in its being difficult
for me to correspond even by letter with those who
are sojourning at a distance, seeing that it has proved
impossible to talk even with myself and to take
counsel with my own soul? At all events, with my
own kith and kin, with the brethren of my own house
and life, citizens of the same Church, I have to communicate
by letters and to get them through seems
impracticable. For it were easier for one to pass,
I say not across the frontier, but even from East to
West, than to visit one part of Alexandria from
another. For that vast, pathless desert which it
took Israel two generations to traverse is not so
impassable and hard to cross as the central street of
the city, nor is the sea, which they had for a carriage-road
when the waters were parted asunder to make a
passage through. And our still and waveless harbours<sup><a id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a></sup>
have become an image of those in the passing
of which the Egyptians were overwhelmed; for
they have often appeared like the Red Sea from the
blood which was in them. And the river which flows
past the city at one time appeared drier than the
waterless desert and more parched than that which
Israel crossed over when they were so thirsty that
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Moses cried out and drink flowed out of the steep
rock from Him that worketh
wonders:<sup><a id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a></sup> and at
another time it was so full as to overflow the whole
neighbourhood, both roads and fields, and to threaten
a return of the flood which occurred in the days of
Noah. But in either case it runs polluted with blood
and slaughter and drowned corpses, as under Moses
it happened to Pharaoh, when the river turned to blood and
stank.<sup><a id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a></sup>
And what other water could cleanse all this but the water which
itself cleanseth all things?<sup><a id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a></sup>
How could the mighty ocean which man cannot cross,
overspread and sweep away this horrid flood? or
how could the great river that goeth out of Eden
wash off the stain, though it were to divert the four
heads into which it is divided into the single head of the
Gihon?<sup><a id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a></sup>
or when would the air, reeking everywhere
with the evil exhalation, become pure? For
such mist from the ground and breezes from the sea,
airs from the rivers and vapours from the harbours
are given off that for dew we have the impure fluids
of corpses rotting in all their component elements.
After all this do men wonder, are they at a loss,
whence come the continual pestilences, whence the
dire diseases, whence the divers ravages, whence the
wholesale destruction of life, why the largest city no
longer contains in it its former multitude of inhabitants,
from infant children to the most advanced in
years, whom it used to nourish in other days to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
green old age,<sup><a id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a></sup> as the saying went, whereas these
from forty up to seventy years of age were so much more
numerous then that their number is not now reached even when all
from fourteen to eighty are enrolled and put together for the
public distribution of food,<sup><a id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a></sup>
and thus those whose looks show them to be quite
young have become as it were of equal age with
those who have long been advanced in years. And
though they see the race of man on earth thus dwindling
ever and being exhausted, they do not tremble,<sup><a id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a></sup>
as its total extinction proceeds and draws near.</p>

<p>Dionysius to Basilides my beloved son and brother

<p>(1) You sent to me, my most faithful and learned son, to inquire
at what hour one ought to end the fast before Easter.<sup><a id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a></sup> For you say that some of the
brethren maintain one should do so at cockcrow:<sup><a id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a></sup>
and some at evening.<sup><a id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a></sup>
For the brethren in Rome, so
they say, await the cockcrow: but concerning those
in the Pentapolis you said they broke the fast sooner.
And you ask me to set an exact limit and a definite
hour, which is both difficult and risky. For it will
be acknowledged by all alike that one ought to start
the feast and the gladness after the time of our Lord&rsquo;s
resurrection, up till then humbling our souls with
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
fastings. But by what you have written to me, you
have quite soundly and with a good insight into the
Divine Gospels established the fact that nothing
definite appears in them about the hour at which He
rose. For the Evangelists described those that came
to the tomb diversely&mdash;that is, at different times, and
all<sup><a id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a></sup> said that they
have found the Lord already risen: it was &ldquo;late on the
Sabbath day,&rdquo; as S. Matthew puts it:<sup><a id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a></sup> and &ldquo;early while
it was yet dark,&rdquo; as S. John writes; and &ldquo;at early
dawn,&rdquo; as S. Luke; and &ldquo;very early ... when the sun was
risen,&rdquo; as S. Mark. And when He rose, no one has
clearly stated; but that &ldquo;late on the Sabbath day, as
it began to dawn towards the first day of the week,&rdquo;
about sunrise on that day those who arrived at the
tomb found Him no longer lying in it, that is agreed to.
And we must not imagine that the evangelists are at
variance and contradict one another: but even if
there seem to be some small dispute upon the matter of your
inquiry&mdash;that is, if though all agree that the Light of the
world<sup><a id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a></sup> our
Lord arose on that night, they differ about the hour, yet let us
be anxious fairly and faithfully to harmonize what is said.</p>
<p>What is said, then, by Matthew runs thus: &ldquo;Late
on the Sabbath day, as it began to dawn towards the
first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the
other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there
was a great earthquake: for an angel of the Lord
descended from heaven and came and rolled away the
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
stone and sat upon it. And his appearance was as
lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for
fear of him the watchers did quake and became as
dead men. And the angel answered and said unto
the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek
Jesus which hath been crucified. He is not here; for
he is risen, even as he said.&rdquo; As to this word which
he uses for &ldquo;late,&rdquo; some will think, in accordance
with its common acceptation, that the evening of the
Sabbath is signified; but others, understanding it
more scientifically, will say it is not that, but &ldquo;the
dead of night,&rdquo; the word used signifying an advanced
stage of lateness.<sup><a id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a></sup> And because he means night and
not evening, he adds &ldquo;as it began to dawn towards the
first day of the week&rdquo; and (the women) had not
yet come, as the rest say, &ldquo;bringing spices&rdquo; but &ldquo;to
see the sepulchre.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a></sup> And they found the earthquake
had occurred and the angel seated on the stone, and
heard from him the words: &ldquo;He is not here: he is
risen.&rdquo; Similarly, John says: &ldquo;On the first day of
the week came Mary Magdalene early, when it was
yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken
away from the tomb.&rdquo; However, by this account,
&ldquo;when it was still dark&rdquo; although towards dawn, He
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
had gone forth from the tomb. But Luke says: &ldquo;On
the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
But on the first day of the week at early dawn
(the women) came unto the tomb bringing the spices
which they had prepared. And they found the stone
rolled away from the tomb.&rdquo; &ldquo;Early dawn&rdquo; indicates,
perchance, the morning light appearing before
(the sun itself) on &ldquo;the first day of the week.&rdquo; In
consequence, it was when the Sabbath had now completely
passed, with the night that followed, and when
a new day was beginning that they came bringing
the spices and ointments, by which time it is clear
that He had risen long before. To this, also, corresponds
what Mark says: &ldquo;(The women) brought
spices that they might come and anoint him. And
very early on the first day of the week they come to
the tomb, when the sun was risen.&rdquo; For he, too,
says &ldquo;very early,&rdquo; which is the same thing as &ldquo;at
early dawn&rdquo;: and he has added, &ldquo;when the sun was
risen.&rdquo; For their start and their journey began, it
is clear, &ldquo;at early dawn&rdquo; and &ldquo;very early&rdquo;:
but they had gone on spending time both on the road and
around the tomb until sunrise. And on this occasion
also<sup><a id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a></sup> the white robed young man says to these
women: &ldquo;He is risen: he is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As things stand thus, we pronounce this decision
for those who inquire to a nicety at what hour or what
half-hour, or quarter of an hour, they should begin
their rejoicing at the Resurrection of our Lord from
the dead: those who are premature and relax before
midnight, though near it, we censure as remiss and
wanting in self-restraint; for they drop out of the
race just before the end, as the wise man says: &ldquo;that
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
which is within a little in life is not little.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a></sup> And those who put off and endure to the furthest
and persevere till the fourth watch, when our Saviour appeared
to those who were sailing also, walking on the sea,<sup><a id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a></sup>
we shall approve as generous and painstaking. And
those midway who stop as they were moved or as they
were able, let us not treat altogether severely. For
all do not continue during the six days of the fast either equally
or similarly:<sup><a id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a></sup> but some remain without food
till cockcrow<sup><a id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a></sup> on all the days,
some on two, or three, or four, and some on none of them. And for
those who strictly persist in these prolonged fasts
and then are distressed and almost faint, there is
pardon if they take something sooner. But if some,
so far from prolonging their fast do not fast at all, but
feed luxuriously during the earlier days of the week,
and then, when they come to the last two and prolong
their fast on them alone, viz. on Friday and Saturday,
think they are performing some great feat by continuing
till dawn, I do not hold that they have
exercised an equal discipline with those who have
practised it for longer periods. I give you this counsel
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in accordance with my judgment in writing on these
points.</p>
<p class="pcomment">[Three rulings follow on points which it is not
necessary to set out here]</p>
<p>(2) These answers I give you from respect for you,
beloved, not because you were ignorant of the subjects
of your inquiry but to render us of one mind and
soul<sup><a id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a></sup>
with yourself, as indeed we are. And I have set
forth my opinion for you to share not as a teacher
but as it becomes us to discuss one with another in all
simplicity: and when you have considered it again,
my most sagacious son, you should write again and
tell me whatever seems to you better or what you
judge to be as I have said.</p>
<p>I pray that you may prosper, my beloved son, as
you minister to the Lord<sup><a id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a></sup> in peace.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">On the Promises</span>&rdquo;
<br /><span class="src">(Eus., <i>H. E.</i> vii. 24 and 25)</span></h3>
<p>(1) Seeing that they bring forward a composition
of Nepos,<sup><a id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a></sup> on which they rely too much as showing
irrefutably that the Kingdom of Christ will be on
earth, though I accept and love Nepos for many other
things, his faith, his laboriousness, his study of the Scriptures,
and the many psalms he has written,<sup><a id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a></sup> by
which already many of the brethren are encouraged,
and though I hold him in all the greater respect because
he has gone to his rest before us, yet the truth
is so dear to me and to be preferred that I can indeed
applaud and give my full assent to right propositions,
but must examine and correct whatever appears
to be unsoundly stated. And if he were still with us
and propounding his views merely by word of mouth,
a discussion without writing would have sufficed to
persuade and convince our opponents by way of
question and answer. But now that this writing of
his is published, which many think most convincing,
and certain teachers hold the law and the prophets
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
of no account and have relinquished the following
of the Gospels and depreciated the Epistles of the
Apostles, while they parade the teaching of this book
as if it were some great and hidden mystery and will
not allow our simpler brethren to hold any high and
noble opinion either about the glorious and truly
Divine appearing of our Lord<sup><a id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a></sup> or about our rising from the dead and our gathering
together and being made like unto Him,<sup><a id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a></sup> but persuade them to
hope for mean and passing enjoyments like the present in
the Kingdom of God, it is necessary that we also
should discuss the matter with our brother Nepos
as if he were still alive.</p>
<p class="pcomment">Further on he adds&mdash;</p>
<p>(2) So being in the district of Arsenoe, where, as
you know,<sup><a id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a></sup> this teaching prevailed long before, so
that both schisms and the defection of whole churches have occurred,
I called together the presbyters and teachers<sup><a id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a></sup> among the brethren in the
villages, such of the brethren as wished being also present, and
invited them publicly to make an examination of the
matter. And when some brought forward against
me this book as an impregnable weapon and bulwark,
I sat with them three days in succession from dawn
till evening and tried to correct the statements made.
During which time I was much struck with the steadiness,
the desire for truth, the aptness in following
an argument and the intelligence displayed by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
brethren, whilst we put our questions and difficulties
and points of agreement in an orderly and reasonable
manner, avoiding the mistake of holding jealously at
any cost to what we had once thought, even though
it should now be shown to be wrong, and yet not suppressing
what we had to say on the other side, but, as
far as possible, attempting to grapple with and master
the propositions in hand without being ashamed to
change one&rsquo;s opinion and yield assent if the argument
convinced us; conscientiously and unfeignedly, with
hearts spread open before God, accepting what was
established by the exposition and teaching of the
holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>At last the champion and mouthpiece of this doctrine, the man
called Coracion,<sup><a id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a></sup> in the hearing of
all the brethren that were present agreed and testified
to us that he would no longer adhere to it nor discourse
upon it nor yet mention nor teach it, on the
ground that he had been convinced by what had been
said against it. And of the rest of the brethren some
rejoiced at the conference and the reconciliation and
harmonious arrangement which was brought about
by it between all parties.</p>
<p class="pcomment">Further on he says this about the Revelation of John&mdash;</p>
<p>(3) Certain people<sup><a id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a></sup> therefore before now discredited
and altogether repudiated the book, both examining
it chapter by chapter and declaring it unintelligible
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and inconclusive and that it makes a false statement in its
title.<sup><a id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a></sup>
For they say it is not John&rsquo;s, no nor yet a
&ldquo;Revelation,&rdquo; because of the heavy, thick veil of
obscurity which covers it:<sup><a id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a></sup>
and not only is the author of this book not one of the Apostles
but he is not even one of the saints nor a churchman at
all;<sup><a id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a></sup>
it is Cerinthus,<sup><a id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a></sup>
the founder of the heresy that was called Cerinthian from him, and
he desired to attribute his own composition to a name that would
carry weight. For the substance of his teaching was this, that
Christ&rsquo;s Kingdom will be on earth, and he dreams
that it will be concerned with things after which he
himself, being fond of bodily pleasures and very
sensual, hankered, such as the satisfying of his
belly and lower lusts, that is eating and drinking and
marrying and such means as he thought would provide
him more decorously with these pleasures, feasts
and sacrifices and the slaying of victims. I should not
myself venture to reject the book, seeing that many
brethren hold it in high esteem, but, reckoning the
decision about it to be beyond my powers of mind, I
consider the interpreting of its various contents to be
recondite and matter for much wonder. For without
fully understanding, I yet surmise that some deeper
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
meaning underlies the words, not measuring and judging them
by calculations of my own; but giving the preference to
faith,<sup><a id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a></sup> I have come to the conclusion
that they are too high for me to comprehend, and so
I do not reject what I have not taken in, but can only
wonder at these visions which I have not even seen
(much less understood).</p>
<p class="pcomment">Besides this, after examining the book as a whole
and showing that it is impossible to understand it in
its literal sense, he proceeds&mdash;</p>
<p>(4) So having completed practically the whole prophecy, the
prophet<sup><a id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a></sup>
pronounces a blessing on
those who keep it and indeed on himself also: for
&ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;is he that observeth the words
of the prophecy of this book and I John who saw and
heard these things.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a></sup>
That he was called John, therefore,
and that the writing is John&rsquo;s I will not dispute.
For I agree that it is the work of some holy and inspired
person but I should not readily assent to his
being the Apostle, the son of Zebedee, the brother of
James, whose is the Gospel entitled &ldquo;According to
John&rdquo; and the General Epistle.<sup><a id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a></sup>
For I conclude that he is not the same (1) from the character
of each, (2) from the style of the language and (3) from what
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
may be called the arrangement of the book. For the
Evangelist nowhere inserts his name nor yet proclaims
himself either in the Gospel or in the Epistle....</p>
<p>(5) But John nowhere speaks either in the first or
in the third person about himself, whereas he that
wrote the Revelation straightway at the beginning
puts himself forward: &ldquo;The Revelation of Jesus
Christ, which he gave him to show to his servants speedily,
and he sent and signified (it) by his angel to his servant John
who bare witness of the word of God and of his testimony, even of
all things that he saw.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a></sup></p>
<p>Then he also writes an Epistle: &ldquo;John to the
seven churches that are in Asia, grace to you and
peace.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a></sup>
Whereas the Evangelist did not put his name even at
the head of the Catholic Epistle but began with the mystery of
the Divine revelation<sup><a id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a></sup> without any superfluous
words: &ldquo;That which was from the beginning,
which we have heard, which we have seen with our
eyes.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a></sup></p>
<p>For it is over this revelation that the Lord also pronounced
Peter blessed, saying: &ldquo;Blessed art thou Simon bar Jona,
because flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee, but my heavenly
Father.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a></sup> Nay, even in the second and third extant
Epistles of John, short
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
though they are, John does not appear by name but
he writes himself &ldquo;the elder&rdquo; anonymously. Whereas
our author did not even consider it sufficient to
mention himself by name once and then proceed with
his subject, but he repeats the name again, &ldquo;I John,
your brother and partaker with you in the tribulation
and kingdom and in the patience of Jesus, was in the
isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and the
testimony of Jesus.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a></sup> In fact, at
the end also he says this: &ldquo;Blessed is he that observeth
the words of the prophecy of this book and I John who saw and
heard these things.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a></sup>
That he which wrote these things, therefore, is John, we must
believe as he says so: but which John is not clear. For he does not
say, as in many places in the Gospel, that he is the
disciple beloved of the Lord, nor the one that reclined
on His breast, nor yet the brother of James, nor yet
the one that was the eyewitness and hearer of the
Lord. Surely he would have used one of the aforesaid
descriptions, when desirous of clearly identifying
himself. And yet he does nothing of the kind, but
calls himself our brother and partaker with us, and
witness of Jesus and blessed for the seeing and hearing
of the revelations. I suppose that many bore the
same name as John the Apostle, who by reason of
their love towards him and from their admiration
and emulation of him and desire to be loved by the
Lord like him, were glad to bear the same name with
him, even as many a one among the children of the faithful is
called Paul or Peter.<sup><a id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a></sup> There is then another
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
John also in the Acts of the Apostles, the one called Mark whom
Barnabas and Paul took with them and of whom it says again:
&ldquo;And they had John as their attendant.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a></sup>
But as to whether he is the
writer, I should say no. For it is not written that
he arrived in Asia with them, but &ldquo;Paul and his company,&rdquo;
it says, &ldquo;set sail from Paphos and came to
Perga in Pamphylia; and John departed from them
and returned to Jerusalem.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a></sup>
And I think there was yet another among those who were in Asia,
since they say there were two tombs in Ephesus and each of them
are said to be the tomb of John.<sup><a id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, from the thoughts and from the actual words and their
arrangement this John may be reasonably reckoned different from
the other.<sup><a id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a></sup>
For the Gospel and the Epistle agree with each other and begin in a
similar way. The one says &ldquo;In the beginning was
the Word:&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;That which was from the
beginning.&rdquo; The one says &ldquo;And the Word became
flesh and tabernacled in us, and we beheld his glory,
glory as of the Only-begotten from the Father:&rdquo;
the other uses the same or almost equivalent expressions,
&ldquo;That which we have heard, that which we
have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld and
our hands handled concerning the Word of Life, and
the Life was manifested.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a></sup>
For he starts in this way
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
because he is dealing, as he shows in what follows,
with those who say that the Lord has not come in the
flesh.<sup><a id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a></sup>
For which reason he is careful to add also:
&ldquo;And we have seen and bear witness and announce
unto you the eternal Life which was with the Father
and was manifested unto us. That which we have
seen and heard we announce also unto you.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a></sup> He
is consistent with himself and does not diverge from
his own propositions, but treats them throughout
under the same heads and in the same terms,
of which we will briefly recall; for instance, the attentive
reader will find in each book frequent mention of
the Life, the Light, the turning from darkness,<sup><a id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a></sup>
constant reference to the Truth, Grace, Joy, the Flesh and
the Blood of the Lord, the Judgment, the Forgiveness
of sins, the Love of God towards us, the command to
us to love one another and that we must keep all the
commandments: again there is the conviction of the
world, of the devil, of the antichrist, God&rsquo;s adoption
of us as Sons, the Faith, which is everywhere required
of us, the Father and the Son everywhere:
and generally throughout in describing the character
of the Gospel and the Epistle one and the same complexion
is to be observed in both. But the Revelation
is quite different from them, foreign, out of touch
and affinity with them, not having, one might almost
say, one syllable in common. The Epistle contains no
reminiscence nor subject dealt with in the Revelation
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
nor the Revelation in the Epistle (to say nothing
of the Gospel), whereas Paul in his Epistles did give
some indication even about those revelations which he has not
actually described.<sup><a id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a></sup></p>
<p>And yet once more one can estimate the difference between the
Gospel and Epistle and the Revelation<sup><a id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a></sup>
from the literary style. For the first two books are
not only written in irreproachable Greek, but are
also most elegant in their phrases, reasonings and
arrangements of expression. No trace can be found
in them of barbarous words, faulty construction or
peculiarities in general. For St. John seems to have
possessed both words, the Lord having graciously
vouchsafed them to him; viz. both the word and knowledge of the
word of speech.<sup><a id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a></sup> That this John
had seen a Revelation and received knowledge and the gift of
prophecy,<sup><a id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a></sup>
I do not deny, but I observe his
dialect and inaccurate Greek style, which employs
barbaric idioms and sometimes even faulty constructions,
which it is not now necessary to expose. For
I have not mentioned this in order to scoff, let no one
think so, but simply to point out the dissimilarity of
the writings.</p>
<h3 id="c6">&ldquo;<span class="sc">On Nature</span>&rdquo;
<br /><span class="src">(Eus., <i>Pr&aelig;p. Evang.</i> xiv. 23-7)</span></h3>
<p>(1) How shall we bear with them when they say
that the wise and, for that reason, the good
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
productions of Creation are the results of chance
coincidences?<sup><a id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a></sup> Each of
which as it came into being by itself appeared to Him that ordered
it to be good and all of them together equally so.</p>
<p>For God &ldquo;saw,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;all things that he had
made, and behold they were very
good.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a></sup> And yet
they take no warning from the small, ordinary instances at their
feet, from which they may learn<sup><a id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a></sup>
that no necessary and profitable work is produced
without design or haphazard, but is adapted to its
proper purpose by handiwork, whereas when it falls
into a useless and unprofitable state, it then breaks
up and comes to pieces indefinite, and, as it chances,
because the wisdom which was concerned in its
construction no longer superintends and directs it.
For a garment is not woven by the woof standing up
without a weaver, nor yet by the warp weaving itself
of its own accord: but when it is becoming worn out,
the torn rags fall asunder. And a house or a city is
built not by receiving certain stones which volunteer
for the foundations and others which jump into the
courses of the walls, but because the builder brings
the stones that fit in the proper order: but when the
building is thrown down, each stone falls to the
ground just as it may. So, too, when a ship is being
built, the keel does not set itself below, while the
mast raises itself in the middle and each of the other
timbers takes the place which it chances to of itself.
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Nor, again, do the planks of a wagon&mdash;said to be
100<sup><a id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a></sup> in number&mdash;become fixed in the position which
each found empty; but the builder in each case puts
the timber together suitably. But if the ship, when
it went upon the sea, or the wagon, when it was
driven along on land, comes to pieces, the timbers are
scattered wherever it may happen&mdash;in the one case
by the waves, in the other by the violent rush.</p>
<p>In the same way it would befit them to say that
the atoms also which are inoperative when they are
at rest and not worked by hands, are also useless when they move
at random.<sup><a id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a></sup> For let these opponents
of ours look to these viewless atoms of theirs and
apply their minds to these mindless ones, not like
the Psalmist who confesses that this was revealed
to him by God alone: &ldquo;Mine eyes beheld thy unfinished
work.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a></sup> So, too, when they say that those
fine webs which they speak of as being produced from
atoms, are self-wrought by them without skill or
sensation, who can bear to hear of these weaver
atoms whom even the spider excels in skill when he spins his web
out of himself.<sup><a id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a></sup></p>
<p>(2) Who, then, is it that discriminates between
the atoms, gathering or scattering them, and arranging
some in this way to make the sun and others in
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
that way for the moon, and putting each of them
together according to the light-giving power of each
star? For the particular number and kind that made
the sun by being united in a particular way would
never have condescended to produce the moon, nor
would the intertwinings of the moon atoms have ever
become the sun. Moreover, even Arcturus, bright
as he is, would never plume himself on having the
atoms of Lucifer, nor the Pleiads those of Orion.
For Paul has well distinguished when he says: &ldquo;There
is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from
star in glory.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a></sup>
And if the combination of the atoms,
as being soulless, was unintelligent, they needed an
intelligent artist to put them together: and if their
junction was without purpose and the result of
necessity, they being void of reason, some wise
herdsman drove them together and presided over
them: and if they have been linked together voluntarily
to do willing service, some wonderful master-craftsman
assigned them their parts and took the
lead; or, like an expert general, he did not leave his
army disordered and all in a muddle, but disposed
the cavalry in one part and the heavy armed troops
apart, and the javelin men by themselves and the
slingers where they ought to be, in order that
those who carried the same weapon might help
one another. And if they think this illustration
ridiculous because in it I make a comparison of
great bodies with small, we will come down to the
very smallest.</p>
<p class="pcomment">[Eusebius&rsquo;s extract breaks off here.]</p>
<p>(3) If the atoms have no ruler over them, to speak
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
to them or to choose or to arrange them, but they
move, settling themselves of their own accord out of
the big rushing tumult and producing a big uproar
as they clash together, like coming to like without the Divine
intervention of which the poet speaks,<sup><a id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a></sup>
and if they run and herd together, recognizing their
kinsfolk, truly the republic of the atoms is a marvellous
one, friends greeting and embracing one another
and hasting to take up their abode in one habitation:
some have rounded themselves off spontaneously into
the sun, that mighty orb, that they may produce the day, and some
perchance have flared up into the many pyramids<sup><a id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a></sup> of stars that they may encircle
the whole expanse of sky, while others are ranged around it,
in order that they may&mdash;albeit undesignedly&mdash;form
the firmament<sup><a id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a></sup> and arch the atmosphere over for
the graduated ascent of the stars, and that the confederation
of these helter-skelter atoms may choose
their abodes and apportion the sky as homes and
stations for themselves.</p>
<p class="tb">(4) So far are these deniers of Divine Providence
from comprehending the invisible parts of the universe
that they do not even see what is visible. For
they appear not even to consider the ordered risings
and settings of the sun, conspicuous though they be,
let alone those of the other heavenly bodies; nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
yet to appreciate the assistance thus given to mankind
through them, the day being lighted up for
work and the night being darkened for rest. For
man shall go forth, it says, to his work and his labour until the
evening.<sup><a id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a></sup>
But they do not even take note of its other<sup><a id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a></sup>
revolution, by which it brings
about the fixed times and fair seasons and the regular
winter and summer solstices, under guidance of its
component atoms. Yet however much these poor creatures dislike it,
it is as the righteous<sup><a id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a></sup>
believe: Great is the Lord that made him: and at His word he hasteneth
his course.<sup><a id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a></sup>
Do atoms, ye blind, bring
you winter and rains, in order that the earth may
produce food for you and all the animals upon it?
do they introduce summer that ye may receive for
your enjoyment the fruits of the trees also? then
why do you not bow down and sacrifice to the atoms
that are the guardians of earth&rsquo;s fruits? ungrateful
truly ye are, never offering them the smallest
firstfruits of the many gifts ye have from them.</p>
<p>(5) The many-tribed and much-mixed populace of
the stars which the much-roving and ever-scattered
atoms composed have (they say) apportioned among
themselves their places according to agreement,
setting up, as it were, a colony or a community,<sup><a id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a></sup>
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
without any founder or controller taking the lead
over them: and they observe the duties of <i>neighbourliness</i>
to one another by compact and peacably, not
transgressing the original bounds which they accepted,
as if they were under the jurisdiction of such atoms
as had regal power. But the atoms do not rule; how could they,
being of no account? Nay, listen to the Divine announcement
(<span title="logia" class="g">&lambda;&#8057;&gamma;&iota;&alpha;</span>):
&ldquo;In the judgment of the Lord are his works from the beginning;
and from the making of them he disposed the parts thereof. He
garnished his works for ever and the beginnings of them unto their
generation.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a></sup></p>
<p class="tb">(6) What well-ordered phalanx ever traversed an
earthly plain, no one stepping in front of others, nor
falling out of the ranks, nor obstructing his comrades,
nor falling behind them, in the way that the stars
advance ever in regular order, shield locked in shield&mdash;that
continuous, unwavering, unencumbered and unembarrassed host? Yet
certain obscure deviations (we are told) arise among them through
clashings and sideward motions:<sup><a id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a></sup>
and that they who devote themselves to their study can always tell
the seasons and foresee the positions at which they will rise. Let,
then, these cutters<sup><a id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a></sup> of the uncuttable and dividers
of the indivisible and combiners of the uncombined
and discerners of the infinite tell us by what means
occurs the encompassing journey round the heavens
in company? it cannot be because a single combination
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
of atoms has been without purpose hurled as
from a sling in this way, seeing that the whole encircling
band goes on its regular rhythmic way and
whirls around together; by what means those multitudinous
fellow-voyagers proceed in company albeit
they are without arrangement or purpose and unknown
to one another? Well did the prophet
include amongst things impossible and undemonstrable
that two strangers should run in company:
Shall two walk at all together, he says, unless they are
acquainted?<sup><a id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a></sup></p>
<p class="tb">(7) (That to work is not toilsome to God.)</p>
<p>To work and to administer and to benefit and to
provide and the like are perchance vexatious to the
idle and thoughtless and feeble and iniquitous, amongst
whom Epicurus enrolled himself, when he conceived
such ideas about the gods. But to the earnest and
capable and intelligent and sober-minded, such as
those who love wisdom (or philosophers) ought to be
(and how much more the gods?), they are not only
not unpleasing and irksome but rather most delightful
and of all things most agreeable; for negligence
and delay in doing something useful is a reproach to them, as the
poet<sup><a id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a></sup>
warns them,<sup><a id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a></sup> when he
counsels: &ldquo;Put not off till the morrow,&rdquo; and further
threatens them: &ldquo;He that procrastinates hath ever to struggle
against disasters,&rdquo; while the
prophet<sup><a id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a></sup>
instructs us still more solemnly when he says that virtuous deeds
are truly godlike, but he that despises them is
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
detestable: &ldquo;for,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;cursed be he that
doeth the works of the Lord negligently.&rdquo; Consequently,
while those who are untaught in any craft and are
imperfect from want of practice and familiarity with
the processes do find toil involved in their endeavours,
those who make progress in it, and still more those
who have reached perfection, are cheered by their
easy success in what they aim at, and would rather
accomplish and bring to completion the tasks they
are accustomed to than have all the good things of
mankind. At all events, Democritus himself, so
they say, used to maintain that he would rather
discover a single reason for a fact than gain the
Persian kingdom;<sup><a id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a></sup>
and that though he seeks his reasons so vainly and unreasonably,
starting as it were from a void beginning and a roving hypothesis
and not observing that fundamental Necessity<sup><a id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a></sup>
which is common to the nature of things existent, but considering
his conception of senseless and mindless
contingencies to be the highest wisdom of setting
up Chance as the mistress and queen of things universal
and even of things divine, and maintaining
that all things occur through her, and yet warning
her off from matters of human life and conduct and
accusing those who give her precedence there to be
devoid of judgment. At all events, at the beginning
of the &ldquo;Precepts,&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a></sup> he says: &ldquo;Men have fashioned
the figure of Chance, as a cloke for their own folly:
for by nature chance fights against judgement.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Thus they (the Epicureans) have said that this very
Chance, the great enemy of intelligence, yet has the
mastery over it; or, rather, by utterly uprooting
and abolishing the one, they set up the other in its
place: for they sing not of intelligence as happy, but
of chance as the equivalent of intelligence.<sup><a id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a></sup>
So, then, those who superintend works of beneficence
pride themselves in measures which advance the
interests of their kind, some as rearers of families,
some as directors of institutions, some as healers of
men&rsquo;s bodies, some as ministers of state, yes, and
those who love wisdom (philosophers) and try hard
to instruct their fellows, likewise give themselves
great airs&mdash;unless Epicurus or Democritus will
venture to maintain that philosophizing is mere
vexation of spirit: but surely there is no pleasure
they would prefer to it. For even though they reckon pleasure
to be the absolute good, yet they will be ashamed to say that
to philosophize (seek wisdom) is not one of the higher forms
of pleasure.<sup><a id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a></sup>
And as to the gods, about whom the poets among
them sing as &ldquo;givers of good gifts&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a></sup>
and these philosophers combine respect with banter,&mdash;the
gods neither give nor partake of any good things.
And in what manner do they find evidence that
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
gods exist? for they do not see them before their
eyes doing anything (even as those who admired
the sun and the moon and the stars said they were called gods
(<span title="theoi" class="g">&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8055;</span>)
because they run
(<span title="theein" class="g">&theta;&#8051;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>)
their course); nor do they attribute to them any creative
or constructive powers, in order that they make
them gods from the word
<span title="theinai" class="g">&theta;&epsilon;&#8150;&nu;&alpha;&iota;</span>
(set, <i>i. e.</i> make):<sup><a id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a></sup>
and on that ground the Maker and Creator of all
things is truly the only God; nor do they put forward
their management or jurisdiction or favours towards
men, in order that we may be induced to worship
them from motives of fear or reverence.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Refutation and Defence&rdquo;</span>
<br /><span class="src">(Eus., <i>Pr&aelig;p. Evang.</i> vii. 19)</span></h3>
<p>(1) They are not pious, who hand over matter to
God as a thing without beginning for His orderly
disposition,<sup><a id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a></sup> maintaining that, being subject to
treatment and change, it yields to the modifications
imposed by God. For they should explain how
both the like and the unlike belong both to God and
to matter. For some one must be imagined superior
to either,<sup><a id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a></sup> and that may not be entertained about
God. For whence came it that there is in them both
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the being without beginning, which is what is said to
be &ldquo;like&rdquo; in both and which is also conceived of
as different from both?<sup><a id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a></sup> For if God is of Himself
without beginning and the being without beginning
is, as some would say, His very essence, matter will
not be without beginning, too: for matter and God
are not identical. But, if each is what it is independently,
and to both belongs in addition the property
of being without beginning, it is clear that the being
without beginning is different from either and older
and higher than both. And thus the difference
between their opposing states is entirely subversive of
their co-existence, or rather of the one, viz. matter
existing of itself. Otherwise let them state the
reason why, both being without beginning, God is
not subject to treatment, unchangeable, immovable,
productive, and matter is the opposite, subject to
treatment, changeable, mobile, varying.</p>
<p>Again, how is it that God and matter came in
contact and combined? Was it that God adapted
Himself to match the nature of matter and exercised
His craft upon it? Nay, that is absurd that God,
like men, should work in gold and stone and busy
Himself in the other handicrafts which the various materials can
give shape and form to.<sup><a id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a></sup></p>
<p>But if God endowed matter with the qualities
which He in His own wisdom determined, impressing
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
on it as with a seal the multiform and diverse shape
and fashion of His own workmanship, this account
of it is both proper and true, and yet further proves
that God, who is the fundamental principle on which
the universe exists, is without beginning. For to
its being (according to them) without beginning
God add its bearing certain qualities. So, then,
there is still much to be said in answer to these views,
but we do not propose to say it now. Nevertheless
they are expressed with more propriety than those
who are absolutely atheistical polytheists.<sup><a id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a></sup></p>
<p class="tb">(2) (Athan., <i>de sent. Dion.</i>, 18). However, when I
spoke of certain things that had an origin
(<span title="gen&ecirc;ta" class="g">&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;&tau;&#8049;</span>)
and certain things that were made
(<span title="poi&ecirc;ta" class="g">&pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&#8049;</span>),
I did indeed casually mention examples of such things,
recognizing that they were not altogether useful for
my purpose: for instance, I said that neither was
the plant the same as the husbandman, nor the boat
as the shipwright. But afterwards I dwelt at length
on those which were more to the point and cognate
to the subject, and went more into detail about these
truer examples, seeking out various additional
evidences which I set out for you<sup><a id="fr_248" href="#fn_248">[248]</a></sup> also in another
letter: and in them I refuted as false the accusation
also which they bring against me, as not stating
that Christ is of one substance
(<span title="homoousios" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&omicron;&#8059;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>)<sup><a id="fr_249" href="#fn_249">[249]</a></sup> with
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the Father. For even if I say<sup><a id="fr_250" href="#fn_250">[250]</a></sup> that this word is not
found nor read anywhere in Holy Writ, yet these
later attempts of mine to explain which they have
ignored are not inconsistent with this conception.
For I compared human generation, which is clearly
a transmission of the parents&rsquo; own nature
(<span title="homogen&ecirc;s" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&#8053;&sigmaf;</span>),
saying that the parents were different from their
children in this single point, that they were not
themselves the children: or else it must needs be
that neither parents nor children should exist. The
letter itself I cannot, as I have said before, owing
to circumstances,<sup><a id="fr_251" href="#fn_251">[251]</a></sup>
lay my hand on: otherwise I
would have sent you my exact words, or rather a
copy of the whole letter: and I will do so, if I have
the opportunity. But I know from memory that I
added several illustrations from things kindred to
one another: for instance, I said that a plant coming
up from a seed or a root was different from that
whence it sprang and yet was absolutely of one nature
(<span title="homophyes" class="g">&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&phi;&upsilon;&#8051;&sigmaf;</span>)
with it: and a river flowing from
a source partakes of a different shape and name;
for neither is the source called river nor the river
source, and both these things exist,<sup><a id="fr_252" href="#fn_252">[252]</a></sup>
and the source is, in a sense, the father and the river is the
water from the source. But these and similar remarks
they pretend never to have seen written, but act as
if they were blind. They only try to pelt me from
afar<sup><a id="fr_253" href="#fn_253">[253]</a></sup> with those poor ill-fitting phrases
of mine<sup><a id="fr_254" href="#fn_254">[254]</a></sup>
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
as with stones, failing to recognize that where a
subject is obscure and requires to be brought within
our understanding, not only do diverse but even
quite contradictory illustrations convey the meaning
sought for.</p>
<p>(3) (<i>Ibid.</i>, 17.)
It has been already said that God
is the Fountain of all good things: and the Son is
described<sup><a id="fr_255" href="#fn_255">[255]</a></sup>
as the stream flowing forth from Him.
For the Word is &ldquo;the effluence&rdquo; of mind, and, to
use human phraseology, is conveyed from the heart
through the mouth, <i>i. e.</i> the mind that finds expression
by means of the tongue, being differentiated
from the word in the heart. For the one having
sent it forth remains and is still what it was; but
the other being sent forth issues and is carried in
all directions: and thus each is in each, being
different one from the other: and they are one, being
two. And it was in this way that the Father and
the Son also were said to be one and in one another.<sup><a id="fr_256" href="#fn_256">[256]</a></sup></p>
<p>Each of the titles employed by me is indivisible
and inseparable from its neighbour. I spoke of the
Father, and before introducing the Son I implied
Him, too, in the Father. I introduced the Son:
even if I had not already mentioned the Father He
would, of course, have been presupposed in the Son.
I added the Holy Spirit: but at the same time I
intimated both from Whom and through Whom<sup><a id="fr_257" href="#fn_257">[257]</a></sup>
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
He came. But they are not aware that the Father
is not separated from the Son <i>qua</i> Father&mdash;for the
title (Father) is suggestive of such connexion (as Son
with Father)&mdash;nor is the Son cut off from the Father;
for the appellation &ldquo;Father&rdquo; denotes their common
bond. And the Spirit is the object of their dealings,<sup><a id="fr_258" href="#fn_258">[258]</a></sup>
being incapable of desertion by either Him that sends,
or Him that conveys. How then can I, who use
these titles, hold that They are wholly divided and
separated?<sup><a id="fr_259" href="#fn_259">[259]</a></sup></p>
<p class="tb">(4) (<i>Ibid.</i>, 23). For, as our mind overflows with
speech<sup><a id="fr_260" href="#fn_260">[260]</a></sup>
of itself, as says the prophet: &ldquo;My heart
overfloweth with good
speech,&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_261" href="#fn_261">[261]</a></sup>
and each is diverse from the other, each occupying its proper place
distinct from the other, the one dwelling and moving in
the heart and the other on the tongue and in the
mouth, and yet they are not entirely unconnected
nor deprived of one another; the mind is not speechless,
nor the speech mindless, but the mind produces
the speech, revealing itself thereby; and the speech
shows the mind, having been gendered therein; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
mind is, as it were, the inlying speech and the speech
is the issuing mind; the mind is transferred into the
speech and the speech displays<sup><a id="fr_262" href="#fn_262">[262]</a></sup>
the mind to the hearers; and thus the mind through the speech gains
a lodgment in the souls of those that hear, entering
together with the speech, and the mind is, as it were,
the father of the speech, having an independent
existence withal; and the speech is, as it were, the
son of the mind, being an impossibility prior to the
mind, yet brought into association with it from any
outside source, but springing from the mind; even
so the Father, who is the Almighty and Universal
Mind, has the Son, the Word as the Interpreter and
Messenger of Himself.</p>

<p>Jerome (in his letter <i>ad Evangelum</i>) is responsible
for the assertion that Dionysius was the last who, in
accordance with the original custom of the Church
of Alexandria, was nominated as Bishop by his
fellow-presbyters there. Subsequently the Bishop
was chosen (at least in theory) by the whole body
of the faithful in the diocese, as in other parts of
Christendom. Jerome&rsquo;s words do not seem to include
consecration also by a fresh laying of hands by the
presbytery, though Bishop Lightfoot (<i>Philippians</i>,
p. 231) inferred from certain other evidence of a not
very decisive kind that this was the case and that it
was rendered necessary at first by the Bishop of
Alexandria having had no other Bishops with him
in Egypt until 190. Others hold that no fresh laying
on of hands at all had been considered necessary,
which is hardly probable. Mr. C. H. Turner (<i>Cambridge
Medieval History</i>, vol. i.) has suggested that
Jerome was misled by Arians who had their own
interests to serve in making the assertion, while he
himself was too ready to credit it in his zeal to uphold
the presbyterate against the arrogant claims of the
Roman deacons at that time. The present writer
ventures to think that Jerome&rsquo;s statement, if correct,
refers only to nomination and that an episcopal
consecrator had been found elsewhere (<i>e. g.</i> in Africa
or Palestine or Syria) for the laying on of hands as usual.</p>

only a presbyter, though later on he became bishop. Possibly
it is from the letter which our Dionysius tells us he wrote
to his Roman namesake and Philemon when they were of
the same opinion as Stephen:
see <a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>.
As far as the contents of the extract go, it is not at all incredible
that Dionysius was willing to admit the validity of such baptisms
as are specified: it was only heresies of a very fundamental

It is to be noticed, however, that this canon of

from <span class="scripRef">Rev. xiii. 5</span>, but the last words
follow a reading which has no support in the MSS. It
should also be noticed that Dionysius does not think it at

<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_126" href="#fr_126">[126]</a></sup>Valerian reigned from 253 till his disappearance

mentioned further
on, but it is difficult to account for the exact epithets which
Dionysius here applies to him. Apparently he had been
Valerian&rsquo;s tutor in some kind of magic, and had allied himself
somehow with the Jewish colony in Alexandria (hence
<span title="archisynag&ocirc;gos" class="g">&#7936;&rho;&chi;&iota;&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&#8049;&gamma;&omega;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>),
who would, of course, be hostile to the Christians.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_131" href="#fr_131">[131]</a></sup>Christian
exorcists must be meant, though the claim to
supernatural powers which Dionysius makes for them is
sufficiently remarkable.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_132" href="#fr_132">[132]</a></sup>This
was a frequent charge against the Christians themselves.
Here Dionysius turns it against their persecutors in Egypt.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_133" href="#fr_133">[133]</a></sup>It is very difficult, without a knowledge of Latin
and Greek, to understand Dionysius&rsquo;s play on words throughout
this section. The office which Macrianus held was that of,
in Latin, <i>Rationalis or Procurator summ&aelig; rei</i>, in Greek
<span title="ho epi t&ocirc;n katholou log&ocirc;n" class="g">&#8001; &#7952;&pi;&#8054; &tau;&#8182;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8057;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon; &lambda;&#8057;&gamma;&omega;&nu;</span>
(something like our Chancellor of the
Exchequer): hence Dionysius says he was not <i>rational</i> (or
reasonable) in his treatment of the Christians and showed
no <i>catholic</i> spirit towards them.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_134" href="#fr_134">[134]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Ezek. xiii. 3</span>. Dionysius
takes the last phrase
(<span title="to katholou" class="g">&tau;&#8056; &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8057;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>),
as if it was the object of the verb, not an adverb,
in order to suit his argument.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_135" href="#fr_135">[135]</a></sup>This may perhaps mean that besides his other faults
Macrianus was tainted with the atheistic views of the
Epicureans, while Dionysius also alludes in this sentence to
the accounts which Macrianus would have to present to the
Emperor of his own administration.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_136" href="#fr_136">[136]</a></sup>Cf.

<span class="scripRef">Col. i. 17</span>.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_137" href="#fr_137">[137]</a></sup>Another play on words, as if
Macrianus was derived from the Greek
<span title="makros" class="g">&mu;&alpha;&kappa;&rho;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span>
(far off), which is somewhat doubtful.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_138" href="#fr_138">[138]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Is. lxvi. 3, 4 (LXX)</span>.
Here the reference is to Valerian
falling into the hands of Sapor, the Persian King, who inflicted
grievous insults upon him, and kept him in captivity
till his death.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_139" href="#fr_139">[139]</a></sup>Macrianus
was lame of one leg. After Valerian&rsquo;s defeat
and disappearance (in 260), for which he was himself largely
responsible, Macrianus and his two sons, Macrianus junior
and Quietus, made an abortive attempt to seize the throne,
which was soon defeated.

</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_141" href="#fr_141">[141]</a></sup>The two Macriani were defeated and
slain by Aureolus, another usurper, in Illyricum, and Quietus
was put to death in the East.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_142" href="#fr_142">[142]</a></sup>Dionysius is still
speaking of Macrianus, who had incited Valerian to attack the
Persians, and then had himself attacked Gallienus and tried to
usurp the throne.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_143" href="#fr_143">[143]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Is. xlii. 9</span>, but Dionysius
has substituted, for the last phrase, a phrase from
<span class="scripRef">xliii. 19</span>. The original prophecy
applies to the triumph of Cyrus and the conversion of the world to
the worship of Jehovah. Its application in the text strikes
us to-day as too fanciful.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_144" href="#fr_144">[144]</a></sup>Whether Gallienus himself
was really a Christian is very
doubtful, but his wife, Cornelia Salonina, seems to have
been.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_145" href="#fr_145">[145]</a></sup>This is a very obscure calculation, but the upshot of
it may be as follows: Gallienus was associated with his father
Valerian as Emperor seven years (253-60), then Macrianus
usurped the power (in Egypt) for one year, or rather more;
thus Gallienus regained the power in his ninth year (<i>i. e.</i> after
midsummer 261). Gallienus&rsquo;s original Edict of Peace was
issued in Oct. 260, but the Rescript applying it to Egypt
was delayed for some time. The Easter festival for which
this letter was written, therefore, must have been that of 262.

for the things that befell us before drove us into many
grievous troubles.&rdquo; But the exact meaning is doubtful,
however we take it.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_149" href="#fr_149">[149]</a></sup>This epithet for martyrs has already occurred on
<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_150" href="#fr_150">[150]</a></sup>This
is none other than a quotation from Pericles&rsquo;s speech
about the plague at Athens in Thucyd. ii. 64, though in
Dionysius&rsquo;s original phrase it sounds as if he meant some
local minor historian.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_151" href="#fr_151">[151]</a></sup>The word Dionysius
uses here is the same as S. Paul, uses
(<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. iv. 13</span>:
<span title="perips&ecirc;ma" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8055;&psi;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</span>,
offscouring). It is said to
have been used at Athens of the human scapegoats thrown
into the river in time of famine: &ldquo;Be thou my expiation
(<span title="perips&ecirc;ma" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8055;&psi;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</span>).&rdquo;
Elsewhere it seems to have degenerated into a
sort of extravagant compliment: &ldquo;I am your humble servant
(<span title="perips&ecirc;ma" class="g">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8055;&psi;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</span>).&rdquo;
Dionysius suggests it might regain its
more serious meaning in the present case.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_152" href="#fr_152">[152]</a></sup>Here
again Dionysius uses an expression suggested by
S. Paul in <span class="scripRef">Phil. iii. 8</span>.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_153" href="#fr_153">[153]</a></sup>It is
not clear whether Dionysius actually alludes here
to the well-protected harbours of Alexandria or (more loosely)
to the Lake Mareotis: probably to the former, because the canal
he refers to in the next sentence (though he calls it a river)
was cut from the Nile into one of the harbours and passed at the
back of the city between it and the Lake Mareotis.

Dionysius evidently adopts the later
Jewish view that the Gihon was the Nile, &AElig;thiopia (or Cush)
being identified with Egypt.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_158" href="#fr_158">[158]</a></sup>The meaning of the phrase employed by Dionysius
here (&ldquo;hale old men&rdquo;) comes from Homer,
<i>Il.</i> xxiii. 791 (cf. Virg., <i>&AElig;n.</i> vi. 304);
but elsewhere a very similar phrase seems to suggest &ldquo;a cruel,
untimely old age.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_159" href="#fr_159">[159]</a></sup>Evidently at Alexandria (the
capital of that country which was the chief granary of Rome) either
the necessitous citizens or perhaps all between forty and seventy
were entitled to receive doles of corn; but now the relief was
extended to all ages between fourteen and eighty.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_160" href="#fr_160">[160]</a></sup>Either the

<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_161" href="#fr_161">[161]</a></sup>The last sentence

<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_162" href="#fr_162">[162]</a></sup>I have
adopted our modern mode of expression, but in

raised without reserve.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_169" href="#fr_169">[169]</a></sup>Dionysius thinks that
S. Matthew&rsquo;s account, with which S. John&rsquo;s tallies,
speaks of the two Marys coming to look at
the tomb about midnight on Easter eve or morning, while
S. Luke and S. Mark mentioned certain women who arrived
at the tomb somewhat later, when the sun had just risen,
but one at least of the Marys mentioned by S. Matthew is
identical with one of those mentioned by S. Mark and
apparently by S. Luke. Possibly, however, Dionysius means
that the two Marys took part in both visits to the tomb.
Dr. Swete on S. Mark and Dr. Westcott on S. John should
be consulted by any one who wishes to pursue the question
further.

putting forward grossly material views of the Millennium. Dionysius
refuted it in a carefully prepared treatise in two books.
This extract is from the second book, and deals chiefly with
the authorship of the Revelation of St. John the Divine in

<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_186" href="#fr_186">[186]</a></sup>Dionysius plays here on the meaning
of the Greek word for Revelation,
<span title="apokalypsis" class="g">&#7936;&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&#8049;&lambda;&upsilon;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
&ldquo;unveiling.&rdquo; He is fond of such a device.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_187" href="#fr_187">[187]</a></sup>If that is the meaning of the words employed, then
&ldquo;saints&rdquo;
(<span title="hagioi" class="g">&#7941;&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&iota;</span>)
is not used in its New Testament sense for the
&ldquo;faithful&rdquo; generally, but a distinction is made more
like the later use of the word for those who attained higher
saintliness than the rest; but perhaps the phrase for
&ldquo;churchmen&rdquo; implies &ldquo;clerical or ecclesiastical
persons,&rdquo; and &ldquo;saints&rdquo; has its earlier sense.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_188" href="#fr_188">[188]</a></sup>Cerinthus was the earliest exponent of Gnostic
views, and as such much abhorred by St. John the Apostle.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_189" href="#fr_189">[189]</a></sup><i>i. e.</i> reckoning that it is a matter where
faith rather than reason should act; or perhaps the translation
should be &ldquo;giving more weight to (the author&rsquo;s)
trustworthiness.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_190" href="#fr_190">[190]</a></sup>This title is to be noticed, as the author himself
never actually describes himself by it. Dionysius is much more
cautious as to the authorship than Origen, his former master,
who attributed the book to St. John the Evangelist without
hesitation, according to Eusebius,
<i>H. E.</i> vi. 25, 9.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_191" href="#fr_191">[191]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Rev. xxii. 7, 8</span>:
but Dionysius has no authority for
joining the latter clause on to the former, its construction
being &ldquo;it is I John who saw and heard.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_192" href="#fr_192">[192]</a></sup><i>i. e.</i> the
First Epistle of St. John; the second and third
were not so described at first and rightly so.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_193" href="#fr_193">[193]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Rev. i. 1, 2</span>.
One might almost think Dionysius was quoting from memory, for he
follows no extant text in omitting &ldquo;God&rdquo; before
&ldquo;gave&rdquo; (thus making Jesus Christ the subject and
&ldquo;him&rdquo; = &ldquo;to John&rdquo;) and &ldquo;the things
which must come to pass&rdquo; before &ldquo;speedily&rdquo;: also he
substitutes &ldquo;his testimony&rdquo; for &ldquo;the testimony of
Jesus Christ,&rdquo; though &ldquo;his&rdquo; still = &ldquo;Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_194" href="#fr_194">[194]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Rev. i. 4</span>.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_195" href="#fr_195">[195]</a></sup>Dionysius seems to contrast the
&ldquo;Divine revelation&rdquo; of
the Epistle which we can trust with that of the Book so-called
about which he felt less sure.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_196" href="#fr_196">[196]</a></sup><span class="scripRef"><span class="scripRef">1 John i. 1</span></span>.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_197" href="#fr_197">[197]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Matt. xvi. 17</span>. Dionysius
substitutes the adjective &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; for &ldquo;which
is in heaven.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_198" href="#fr_198">[198]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Rev. i. 9</span>.

</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_200" href="#fr_200">[200]</a></sup>It would seem likely, but by no means
certain, that Dionysius is speaking of strictly baptismal names
here. We have very slight grounds for being sure that the custom of
connecting the giving of a name at baptism was universal as
early as this.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_201" href="#fr_201">[201]</a></sup>See

<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_203" href="#fr_203">[203]</a></sup>This assertion is taken
almost verbatim from
Eus., <i>H. E.</i> iii. 39,
where a passage is also quoted from Papias in which
John the Elder is mentioned as well as John the Apostle
among the Lord&rsquo;s disciples.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_204" href="#fr_204">[204]</a></sup>This is the second argument which Dionysius adduces,
but he seems as if he now includes the third with it. See above.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_205" href="#fr_205">[205]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">John i. 1</span>,

</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_208" href="#fr_208">[208]</a></sup>It
looks as if this phrase may be a marginal gloss on
the Light, which has crept into the text, as it occurs nowhere
in the writings of St. John nor elsewhere in the New Testament;
but the same might be said of the &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; below,
and one or two others of the other phrases are quite rare in St.
John&rsquo;s writings, so that they may be all instances of the
thoughts, not the words being identical in the two books.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_209" href="#fr_209">[209]</a></sup>The reference is to such passages as
<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. xii. 1 ff.</span>,

<span class="scripRef">ii. 2</span>, etc.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_210" href="#fr_210">[210]</a></sup>This is the third
argument.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_211" href="#fr_211">[211]</a></sup>A rather forced and fanciful statement.
Dionysius appears loosely to refer to
<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. xii. 8</span>, somewhat boldly
substituting &ldquo;of speech&rdquo;
(<span title="t&ecirc;s phrase&ocirc;s" class="g">&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &phi;&rho;&#8049;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;</span>)
for St. Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;of wisdom.&rdquo;
</div>

</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_215" href="#fr_215">[215]</a></sup>The argument appears to be
that, as on a small scale design is &ldquo;evident in the
construction or repairing of a thing but is absent in its
decay,&rdquo; so the orderly creation and maintenance of the
Universe on the large scale implies intelligent direction.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_216" href="#fr_216">[216]</a></sup>Hesiod (<i>Works and Days</i>, 554) is meant, but of course
100 stands here, as elsewhere, for an indefinitely large number.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_217" href="#fr_217">[217]</a></sup>The point is that movement which is useful suggests
design: but as the movement of the atoms is without
design, it cannot be useful.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_218" href="#fr_218">[218]</a></sup><span class="scripRef">Ps. cxxxviii. (cxxxix.) 16</span>. Dionysius quotes the best text
here of LXX, but his application is rather obscure. Apparently
he means that the Epicureans claimed to know without
either revelation or research what the Psalmist knew only
by revelation from God.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_219" href="#fr_219">[219]</a></sup>Dionysius says that even the spider has more
notion of design than the atoms, but the sarcasm is not quite to the
point.

a proverb quoted both by Plato and Aristotle.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_222" href="#fr_222">[222]</a></sup>Dionysius is
probably thinking of Plato&rsquo;s <i>Tim&aelig;us</i> 56B,
where the pyramid is said to be the geometrical shape of fire
which is the principal constituent of the bodies of the stars
(Professor H. Jackson).
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_223" href="#fr_223">[223]</a></sup>Dionysius is here referring to such a passage as
<span class="scripRef">Gen. i. 6 ff</span>. No doubt the ancients thought the
vault of heaven was solid, enclosing the atmosphere which covers the
earth, and that the stars were either fixed upon it or moved in
their courses on its surface.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
